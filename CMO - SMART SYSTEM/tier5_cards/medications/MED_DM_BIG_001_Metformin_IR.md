## UNDERSTANDING YOUR MEDICATION

**What is Metformin?**
Metformin is a diabetes medication that's been helping people for over 60 years. It's the most-prescribed diabetes medication in the world because it works well and is very safe.

**How does it work?**
Your body normally releases sugar from your liver and uses it for energy. With diabetes, your liver releases too much sugar. Metformin:
1. Tells your liver to release less sugar
2. Helps your muscles use sugar more efficiently
3. Slightly slows sugar absorption from food

**What makes it special?**
- Won't cause low blood sugar when taken alone
- Doesn't cause weight gain (many people lose a little weight)
- Protects your heart
- Very affordable
- 60+ years of safety data

---

## YOUR DOSING SCHEDULE

| Form | Sizes Available |
|------|-----------------|
| Immediate Release (IR) | 500mg, 850mg, 1000mg tablets |
| Extended Release (ER) | 500mg, 750mg, 1000mg tablets |

**Your schedule:** Twice daily - with breakfast and dinner
**Why with food?** Dramatically reduces stomach upset

**If you miss a dose:** Take it with your next meal. Never take two doses at once.

---

## WHAT TO EXPECT

### First 2-4 Weeks (Getting Started)
Many people experience stomach upset early on. This is normal and usually goes away:
- Upset stomach or nausea
- Loose stools or diarrhea
- Metallic taste in mouth

**These typically improve by week 3-4.** If they don't, we have solutions.

### After 1-3 Months
- More stable energy levels
- Fewer sugar cravings
- Your A1c will show improvement (even if you don't "feel" different)
- Possible mild weight loss

### Long-Term Benefits
- Lower blood sugar
- Reduced risk of diabetes complications
- Heart protection
- Better overall metabolic health

---

## MONITORING & LABS

| Test | How Often | Why |
|------|-----------|-----|
| A1c | Every 3 months → every 6 months when stable | Shows your 3-month blood sugar average |
| Kidney function (eGFR) | Every 3-6 months initially → yearly | Ensures kidneys are handling the medication well |
| Vitamin B12 | Yearly | Metformin can lower B12 over time |

**Your target:** A1c below 7.0% (or the goal your care team sets for you)

---

## WHEN TO PAUSE YOUR MEDICATION

There are specific times when you should temporarily stop taking Metformin:

| Situation | What to Do |
|-----------|------------|
| Getting a CT scan or MRI with contrast dye | Stop 48 hours before AND after the scan |
| Severely sick with vomiting/diarrhea/dehydration | Hold until you're better |
| Having surgery | Hold the day of your procedure |

**When in doubt, call us.** You can always restart when the situation resolves.

---

## LIFESTYLE & INTERACTIONS

**Food:** Take with meals. Avoid very greasy foods initially if you're having stomach issues.

**Alcohol:** Limit to 1-2 drinks per day. More than that increases risks.

**Other medications to be aware of:**
- If you take regular NSAIDs (ibuprofen, naproxen), your kidney function should be monitored
- Always tell any doctor or imaging center that you take Metformin before contrast scans

---

## COMMON QUESTIONS

**"I don't feel any different. Is it working?"**
Metformin works silently in the background. Most people don't "feel" their blood sugar changing - that's why we check A1c. Think of it like blood pressure medication: you don't feel it working, but it is.

**"My stomach is really upset. Should I stop?"**
Not yet! This is the most common early side effect and usually improves by week 3-4. Try eating more food with your pill and avoiding greasy foods. If it doesn't improve after 4 weeks, we can switch you to the extended-release version.

**"I forgot my pills for a few days. What now?"**
Just restart with your next meal. No need to make up missed doses. Mention it at your next check-in.

**"Can I ever stop taking this?"**
For some people, yes. If your A1c drops to normal range (under 5.7%) and stays there for 6 months with good lifestyle habits, we can discuss a supervised taper. This is uncommon but possible.

## WHEN TO REACH OUT

**Schedule a visit for:**
- Stomach issues that haven't improved after 4 weeks
- Extreme tiredness
- Questions about your progress

**Seek immediate care for:**
- Difficulty breathing
- Severe muscle pain
- Feeling very cold with slow heartbeat
- Signs of severe dehydration

## CLINICAL SUMMARY

### Overview
Metformin hydrochloride (Glucophage) is a biguanide antihyperglycemic agent that remains the preferred first-line pharmacologic therapy for Type 2 diabetes mellitus per ADA, EASD, and AACE guidelines. Mechanism includes hepatic gluconeogenesis suppression, enhanced peripheral insulin sensitivity, and delayed intestinal glucose absorption.

### Key Clinical Points
- **A1c reduction:** 1.0-1.5% from baseline
- **Cardiovascular benefit:** Only oral diabetes agent with proven mortality reduction (UKPDS)
- **Weight effect:** Neutral to slight loss (contrast to sulfonylureas, TZDs)
- **Hypoglycemia risk:** Minimal as monotherapy
- **NNT:** 14 to prevent one complication over 10 years

### Contraindications
- eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73m²
- History of lactic acidosis
- Acute decompensated heart failure
- Severe hepatic impairment

### Renal Dosing
| eGFR | Recommendation |
|------|----------------|
| ≥ 60 | Full dose |
| 45-59 | Full dose, monitor q3-6mo |
| 30-44 | Max 1000mg/day, monitor q3mo, avoid initiation if <45 |
| < 30 | Contraindicated |

### Common Drug Interactions
| Agent | Severity | Management |
|-------|----------|------------|
| Iodinated contrast | High | Hold 48h before and after; verify eGFR before resuming |
| Chronic NSAID use | Moderate | Monitor renal function |
| Alcohol (excessive) | Moderate | Counsel limitation; increases lactic acidosis risk |
| Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors | Moderate | May increase lactic acidosis risk |

### Monitoring Protocol
| Parameter | Frequency |
|-----------|-----------|
| A1c | q3mo until stable → q6mo |
| eGFR/Cr | q3-6mo initially → annually |
| Vitamin B12 | Annually (deficiency in 5-10% long-term) |

### Treatment Failure Considerations
If A1c not at goal after 3 months at maximum tolerated dose:
- **With ASCVD/high CV risk:** Add SGLT2i (empagliflozin, dapagliflozin) or GLP-1 RA
- **With CKD/proteinuria:** Add SGLT2i
- **With obesity priority:** Add GLP-1 RA (semaglutide, tirzepatide)
- **Cost constraints:** Add sulfonylurea or TZD

### Evidence Base
| Study | Design | Key Finding |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| UKPDS 34 | RCT, n=1,704, 10yr | 32% reduction in diabetes-related endpoints, 36% all-cause mortality reduction in overweight patients |
| HOME Study | RCT, n=390 | CV benefit in insulin-treated T2DM |
| Cochrane 2012 | Meta-analysis, 35 RCTs | Confirmed 1.0-1.5% A1c reduction |

**Evidence gaps:** Limited RCT data for eGFR 30-45; no large head-to-head trials vs newer agents as first-line.

### Feasibility Score: 75/100

| Factor | Points |
|--------|--------|
| Baseline | 100 |
| GI tolerability concerns | -15 |
| BID dosing requirement | -5 |
| Lab monitoring | -5 |
| Low cost/affordability | +10 |
| No hypoglycemia risk | +5 |
| Weight neutral | +5 |

### Patient Confidence Assessment
Ask at prescribing: "On a scale of 0-10, how confident are you that you can take this medication twice daily with meals?"

| Score | Interpretation | Action |
|-------|----------------|--------|
| 8-10 | High confidence | Proceed with standard initiation |
| 5-7 | Moderate confidence | Explore barriers, consider additional support |
| 0-4 | Low confidence | Address barriers before starting; may need motivational interviewing |
