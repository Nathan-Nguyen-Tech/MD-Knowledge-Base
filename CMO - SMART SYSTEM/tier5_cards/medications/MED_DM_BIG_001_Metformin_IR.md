## WHAT YOU'RE DOING
Taking Metformin twice daily to lower your blood sugar and protect your heart.

## WHY THIS MATTERS
**Your goal:** [Patient's own words - captured at intake]

**Why prescribed:** First-choice diabetes medication. Lowers blood sugar, protects heart, no weight gain.

**Evidence:** Grade A - Proven effective over 60 years, reduces complications by 32%.

## HOW TO DO IT
1. Take one pill **with breakfast**
2. Take one pill **with dinner**
3. **Always eat food** when you take it
4. Swallow whole with water

**Tip:** Keep pills next to your coffee maker or dinner plate.

## DOSE PROGRESSION

```
🟢 Week 1-2 → 500mg AM  +  500mg PM   (starting)
🟡 Week 3-4 → 500mg AM  + 1000mg PM   (building)
🟣 Week 5+  → 1000mg AM + 1000mg PM   (target)
```
*Advance only when tolerating well.*

## WHAT TO WATCH FOR

## WHO

| Role | Responsibility |
|------|----------------|
| Patient | Take as prescribed, report side effects, communicate barriers |
| Prescriber | Prescribe, adjust dose, monitor labs |
| Pharmacist | Dispense, counsel on use |
| Care Team | Check-ins, education, troubleshooting |
| Family | Reminders, watch for warning signs |

---

## WHAT

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Medication | Metformin Hydrochloride (Glucophage) |
| Class | Biguanide |
| Starting Dose | 500mg twice daily |
| Target Dose | 1000mg twice daily |
| Maximum | 2550mg/day |
| Form | Oral tablet |

---

## WHEN

**Schedule:** Twice daily with breakfast and dinner
**Duration:** Ongoing (chronic therapy)
**Missed dose:** Take with next meal. Never double up.

---

## WHERE

**Setting:** Home, with meals
**Storage:** Room temperature, away from moisture

---

## WHY (Mechanism)

1. **Reduces** liver glucose production
2. **Improves** muscle insulin sensitivity
3. **Slows** intestinal glucose absorption

**Benefits:** No hypoglycemia risk (monotherapy). Weight neutral or slight loss. Cardiovascular protection.

---

## HOW

**Instructions:**
1. Take with first bite of food (not before eating)
2. Swallow whole with water
3. Same times daily for consistency

**If stomach upset:**
- Eat more food with it
- Avoid greasy foods initially
- Usually resolves by week 3-4
- Extended-release (ER) option if persistent

---

## MEASURE

| Test | Frequency | Purpose |
|------|-----------|---------|
| A1c | q3mo → q6mo when stable | 3-month glucose average |
| eGFR | q3-6mo initially → annually | Kidney safety |
| B12 | Annually | Metformin lowers B12 absorption |

**What you may notice:** More energy, fewer cravings, possible mild weight loss

---

## TARGET

| Metric | Goal | Timeline |
|--------|------|----------|
| A1c | < 7.0% | 3-6 months |
| A1c reduction | 1.0-1.5% | Expected drop |
| Glucose improvement | Noticeable | 2-4 weeks |

---

## SAFETY

### Common Side Effects (Temporary: 30-50%)
- Stomach upset, nausea
- Diarrhea
- Metallic taste

### Hold Medication If:
| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Severely dehydrated/ill | Hold until resolved |
| IV contrast imaging | Hold 48h before AND after |
| Surgery (NPO) | Hold day of procedure |

### Drug Interactions:
| Substance | Guidance |
|-----------|----------|
| Alcohol | Limit 1-2 drinks/day |
| NSAIDs (chronic) | Monitor kidney function |
| IV contrast | Hold protocol above |

## FOLLOW-UP SCHEDULE

### Phase 1: Initiation (Days 1-14)
| Day | Method | Focus |
|-----|--------|-------|
| 3 | App/text | GI tolerance, taking with food? |
| 7 | App/phone | Tolerating? Barriers? |
| 14 | App/phone | Ready to advance dose? |

### Phase 2: Titration (Weeks 3-12)
| When | Method | Focus |
|------|--------|-------|
| Week 4 | Phone/visit | Dose increase to target |
| Week 8 | App | Adherence check |
| Month 3 | Lab + visit | A1c recheck |

### Phase 3: Maintenance (Month 4+)
| When | Method | Focus |
|------|--------|-------|
| Monthly | App | Quick adherence check |
| q3-6mo | Lab + visit | A1c, eGFR |
| Yearly | Comprehensive | B12, full medication review |

---

## IF YOU'RE STRUGGLING

**Missed days?** Restart with next meal. No doubling.
**Missed week+?** Restart at current dose. Mention at next check-in.

### Common Barriers & Solutions

| Barrier | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Forgetting | Pill organizer, phone alarm, anchor to meals |
| GI issues | More food, wait 3-4 weeks, switch to ER |
| "Not feeling different" | Works silently - A1c shows the change |
| Travel/schedule changes | Take with any meal; timing flexible |

## EVIDENCE

### Summary
Metformin is the most extensively studied diabetes medication with 60+ years of clinical use. Multiple large trials and every major guideline recommend it as first-line therapy. It reliably lowers blood sugar and, uniquely among diabetes drugs, has proven cardiovascular benefits.

### Grade: A (Strongest)

### Grading Criteria Met
- [x] Multiple systematic reviews/meta-analyses
- [x] Multiple large, well-designed RCTs with consistent results
- [x] Endorsed by all major guideline bodies (ADA, EASD, AACE)
- [x] Extensive real-world effectiveness data
- [x] Benefits clearly outweigh risks

### Key Studies

| Study | Finding |
|-------|---------|
| **UKPDS 34** (n=1,704, 10yr) | 32% reduction in complications, 36% reduction in mortality |
| **Cochrane Review** (35 RCTs) | A1c reduction 1.0-1.5% vs placebo |
| **ADA 2024 Guidelines** | "Preferred initial pharmacologic agent for T2DM" |

**NNT:** 14 (to prevent one complication over 10 years)

### Evidence Gaps
- Limited RCT data for eGFR 30-45
- No large head-to-head vs newer agents as first-line
- Optimal CV dosing not established

**Last Reviewed:** December 2024

## NOTES

### Feasibility Score: 75/100 (Clinician Reference)
| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| Base | 100 |
| GI effects | -15 |
| BID dosing | -5 |
| Lab monitoring | -5 |
| Affordable | +10 |

| Weight neutral | +5 |

### Patient Confidence Assessment
*Ask at prescribing:* "On a scale of 0-10, how confident are you that you can take this medication twice daily with meals?"

| Score | Interpretation | Action |
|-------|----------------|--------|
| 8-10 | Ready | Proceed |
| 5-7 | Uncertain | Explore barriers |
| 0-4 | Concerned | Address before starting |
