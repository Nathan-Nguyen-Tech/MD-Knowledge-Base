- Pharmacist: Dispenses, counsels on use
- Nurse: Check-ins, education, troubleshooting

**Support People:**
- Family/caregiver: Reminders, watching for warning signs

---

## WHAT

**Medication:** Metformin Hydrochloride (Glucophage)
**Class:** Biguanide
**Dose:** 500mg → titrating to 1000mg twice daily
**Form:** Oral tablet

---

## WHEN

**Schedule:** Twice daily with breakfast and dinner
**Duration:** Ongoing
**Missed dose:** Take with next meal. Don't double up.

### Dose Progression

| Week | Morning | Evening |
|------|---------|---------|
| 1-2 | 500mg | 500mg |
| 3-4 | 500mg | 1000mg |
| 5+ | 1000mg | 1000mg |

*Advance only when tolerating well.*

---

## WHERE

**Setting:** Home, with meals
**Storage:** Room temperature, away from moisture

---

## WHY

**Mechanism:**
1. Reduces liver glucose production
2. Improves muscle insulin sensitivity
3. Slows intestinal glucose absorption

**Benefits:** No hypoglycemia risk (monotherapy). Weight neutral or slight loss. Cardiovascular protection.

---

## HOW

### Instructions
1. Take with first bite of food (not before eating)
2. Swallow whole with water
3. Same times daily for consistency

### If Stomach Upset
- Eat more food with it
- Avoid greasy foods initially
- Usually resolves by week 3-4
- Extended-release option if persistent

---

## MEASURE

| Test | Frequency | Purpose |
|------|-----------|---------|
| A1c | q3mo → q6mo when stable | 3-month glucose average |
| eGFR | q3-6mo initially | Kidney safety |
| B12 | Annually | Metformin lowers B12 |

**What you may notice:** More energy, fewer cravings, possible weight loss

---

## TARGET

**A1c goal:** Below 7.0%
**Timeline:** 3-6 months

**Expected results:**
- Glucose improving: 2-4 weeks
- Full A1c effect: 3 months
- Typical A1c reduction: 1.0-1.5%

---

## SAFETY

### Common Side Effects (Temporary)
- Stomach upset, nausea (30-50%)
- Diarrhea
- Metallic taste

### Contact Care Team If:
- GI symptoms persist >4 weeks
- Unusual tiredness
- Numbness/tingling extremities
- Scheduled for contrast imaging

### Emergency (Call 911):
- Trouble breathing
- Severe muscle pain
- Feeling very cold + slow heartbeat
- Severe stomach pain + vomiting

### Hold If:
- Severely dehydrated or acutely ill
- IV contrast (48h before/after)

### Interactions:
| Substance | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Alcohol | Limit 1-2 drinks |
| NSAIDs | Use sparingly |
| IV contrast | Hold 48h |

---

## FOLLOW-UP

### Phase 1: Initiation (Days 1-14)
| Day | Method | Focus |
|-----|--------|-------|
| 3 | App/text | GI tolerance |
| 7 | App/phone | Barriers |
| 14 | App/phone | Dose advancement |

### Phase 2: Titration (Weeks 3-12)
| When | Method | Focus |
|------|--------|-------|
| Week 4 | Phone/visit | Dose increase |
| Week 8 | App | Adherence |
| Month 3 | Lab + visit | A1c recheck |

### Phase 3: Maintenance (Month 4+)
| When | Method | Focus |
|------|--------|-------|
| Monthly | App | Quick check |
| q3-6mo | Lab + visit | A1c, eGFR |
| Yearly | Comprehensive | B12, full review |

### Decision Tree:
| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| A1c at goal | Continue, extend intervals |
| A1c elevated after 3mo max dose | Add second agent |
| Persistent GI | Switch to ER formulation |
| eGFR declining | Adjust dose or discontinue |

---

## IF YOU'RE STRUGGLING

**Missed days?** Restart with next meal. No doubling.

**Missed week+?** Restart at current dose. Notify at next check-in.

### Barriers & Solutions

| Barrier | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Forgetting | Pill organizer, alarm, anchor to meals |
| GI issues | More food, wait 3-4 weeks, try ER |
| No perceived effect | Works silently - A1c shows it |
| Travel | Take with any meal; timing flexible |

## EVIDENCE

### Summary
Metformin is the most extensively studied diabetes medication with over 60 years of clinical use. Multiple large trials and every major diabetes guideline recommend it as first-line therapy. It reliably lowers blood sugar and uniquely among diabetes drugs, has proven cardiovascular benefits.

### Grade: A

### Grading Criteria Met
- [x] Supported by multiple systematic reviews/meta-analyses
- [x] Multiple large, well-designed RCTs with consistent results
- [x] Endorsed by all major guideline bodies (ADA, EASD, AACE)
- [x] Extensive real-world effectiveness data
- [x] Benefits clearly outweigh risks

### Primary Sources

#### Guideline: ADA Standards of Care in Diabetes
- **Organization:** American Diabetes Association
- **Year:** 2024
- **Recommendation:** "Metformin is the preferred initial pharmacologic agent for type 2 diabetes"
- **Strength:** Strong (Level A)
- **Link:** diabetesjournals.org/care

#### Guideline: ADA/EASD Consensus Report
- **Organization:** American Diabetes Association / European Association for the Study of Diabetes
- **Year:** 2022
- **Recommendation:** "Metformin remains first-line therapy for most patients with T2DM"
- **Strength:** Strong consensus

#### Trial: UKPDS 34 (UK Prospective Diabetes Study)
- **Citation:** UK Prospective Diabetes Study Group. Lancet. 1998;352(9131):854-865
- **Design:** Randomized controlled trial
- **Population:** Newly diagnosed T2DM, overweight patients
- **N:** 1,704
- **Follow-up:** Median 10.7 years
- **Key Findings:**
  - 32% reduction in diabetes-related endpoints (p=0.002)
  - 42% reduction in diabetes-related death (p=0.017)
  - 36% reduction in all-cause mortality (p=0.011)
- **NNT:** 14 (to prevent one diabetes-related endpoint over 10 years)
- **Limitations:** Overweight subgroup only; open-label design

#### Meta-Analysis: Cochrane Review
- **Citation:** Hirst JA, et al. Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2012
- **Design:** Systematic review of 35 RCTs
- **Key Finding:** Metformin reduces HbA1c by ~1.0-1.5% vs placebo

### Supporting Evidence

**A1c Reduction:** Consistent 1.0-1.5% reduction across trials, effect maintained long-term

**Cardiovascular Outcomes:** UKPDS showed CV mortality benefit maintained at 10-year follow-up; HOME trial showed reduced macrovascular events

**Weight Effects:** Weight neutral to modest loss (-1-2 kg); does not cause hypoglycemia as monotherapy

**Safety Profile:** 60+ years post-marketing experience; lactic acidosis extremely rare (4.3 per 100,000 patient-years)

### Evidence Gaps
- Limited RCT data in patients with eGFR 30-45
- No large RCTs comparing to newer agents as first-line
- Optimal dosing for CV benefit not established

### Last Evidence Review
December 2024

---

## NOTES

### Feasibility Score (Clinician Reference): 75/100
- Base: 100
- Deductions: GI effects (-15), BID dosing (-5), monitoring (-5)
- Boosters: Affordable (+10), no hypoglycemia (+5), weight neutral (+5)

### Patient Confidence Assessment
Ask: "On a scale of 0-10, how confident are you that you can take this medication twice daily with meals?"
- 8-10: Ready to start
- 5-7: Explore barriers
- 0-4: Address concerns first
