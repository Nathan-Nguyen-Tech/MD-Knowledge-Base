### WHERE

- **Setting:** Home (self-administered)
- **Storage:** Room temperature (68-77°F), protect from moisture
- **Access:** Any pharmacy - widely available generic

---

### WHY

**Clinical Goal (Performance Medicine Framework):**
- **Primary:** Metabolic System: Improve Function (glucose regulation)
- **Secondary:** Cardiovascular System: Reduce Risk (proven CV mortality benefit)

**Patient's Personal Goal:**
[Patient's own words - customize per individual]
Example: "I want to be around to meet my grandkids. I don't want to end up like my dad who died of a heart attack at 68."

**Connection:**
Your A1c shows you have type 2 diabetes. Metformin is the #1 medicine we start with because it works well, is affordable, and actually helps protect your heart - not just your blood sugar. Taking this consistently is one of the best things you can do for your long-term health.

**Mechanism of Action:**
Metformin works in three ways:
1. **Reduces hepatic glucose production** - Your liver makes less sugar
2. **Improves insulin sensitivity** - Your muscles use insulin better
3. **Slows intestinal glucose absorption** - Sugar from food absorbs more slowly

Unlike sulfonylureas, metformin does NOT cause hypoglycemia when used alone and is weight-neutral or promotes modest weight loss.

**Evidence:**
- **Source:** ADA Standards of Care 2024; UKPDS Trial (1998); Cochrane Review (2020)
- **Grade:** **A** (Extensive RCT evidence, 60+ years clinical experience)
- **Summary:** First-line therapy for T2DM. Reduces A1c by 1.0-1.5%. UKPDS showed 32% reduction in diabetes-related endpoints and 36% reduction in all-cause mortality in overweight patients. Excellent long-term safety profile.

**Expected Timeline (Time-to-Benefit):**
- Blood sugar improvement: 2-4 weeks
- Maximum A1c reduction: 3 months (full effect)
- CV risk reduction: Develops over years of use

**DISCLAIMER:**
These timelines are based on average patient outcomes. Your individual results may vary based on adherence, your body's response, other health conditions, medications, and lifestyle factors. If you're not seeing improvement in the expected timeframe, contact your care team.

### HOW

**Detailed Step-by-Step Instructions:**

1. Take tablet(s) with breakfast - swallow whole with water
2. Take tablet(s) with dinner - swallow whole with water
3. **ALWAYS take with food** - this is critical for tolerability
4. Store at room temperature away from moisture
5. Refill prescription before running out (don't skip doses)

**If GI Side Effects Occur:**
- Ensure you're taking WITH food (not just "after")
- Consider temporarily stepping back one tier
- Discuss switching to extended-release (Metformin ER) with provider

**Synergy Tips (Habit Stacking):**
- **Pair with:** Home Glucose Monitoring card - see the impact of your medication
- **Pair with:** "Reduce Sugary Drinks" card - cutting sodas amplifies metformin's effect
- **Pair with:** Walking card - exercise + metformin is more effective than either alone
- **Pair with:** Lisinopril card (if prescribed) - both protect kidneys, powerful combo for diabetics

**Occupation-Specific Tips:**
- Pack enough medication for work trips
- Keep crackers/snacks available if you take it and then can't eat
- Set phone alarms for consistent timing

---

### MEASURE

**Tracking Method:**
- **Primary:** Hemoglobin A1c (reflects 3-month average glucose)
- **Secondary:** Fasting blood glucose (FBG) via fingerstick

**Frequency:**
- A1c: [Every 3 months until stable | Then every 6 months]
- Fasting glucose: [Daily first 2 weeks | Then 2-3x/week | Then as directed]

**Tools Needed:**
- Blood glucose meter + test strips + lancets (for home monitoring)
- Lab order for A1c (covered by insurance for diabetics)

**Additional Monitoring:**
- Renal function (eGFR): [Every 3-6 months initially | Annually when stable]
- Vitamin B12: [Annually | More often if symptoms of deficiency]

---

### TARGET

**Primary Goal:**
- A1c: [<7.0% | Adjust for: Elderly/frail (target <8.0%), hypoglycemia risk, limited life expectancy (individualize)]
- Fasting glucose: [80-130 mg/dL | Adjust for: Age, hypoglycemia history]

**Timeline:** [3-6 months to goal | Range: 3-12 months | Depends on: Baseline A1c, adherence, lifestyle changes]

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ A1c at individualized target
- ✅ Fasting glucose consistently in target range
- ✅ No hypoglycemia (metformin alone rarely causes this)
- ✅ GI side effects manageable or resolved
- ✅ No signs of B12 deficiency
- ✅ Stable renal function

---

### SAFETY

**🟡 YELLOW - Common Side Effects (Monitor, usually improve):**
- GI upset, nausea (30-50%) - **improves over 2-4 weeks**
- Diarrhea (10-30%) - **take with food to minimize**
- Metallic taste (3-5%)
- Gas, bloating

**Tip:** GI side effects are VERY common initially but almost always improve. Take with food, start low, go slow.

**🟠 ORANGE - Contact Care Team If:**
- GI symptoms don't improve after 4 weeks despite taking with food
- Severe stomach pain
- Extreme tiredness out of proportion to activity
- Getting imaging with IV contrast (HOLD metformin - call for instructions)
- Signs of B12 deficiency (numbness/tingling in hands/feet, fatigue, weakness)
- eGFR declining on labs

**🔴 RED - Emergency - Call 911 (Lactic Acidosis - Very Rare):**
- Trouble breathing
- Severe muscle pain or cramping
- Unusual sleepiness or extreme weakness
- Feeling very cold
- Dizziness, lightheadedness
- Slow or irregular heartbeat
- Severe stomach pain with nausea/vomiting

**Note:** Lactic acidosis is extremely rare (~1 in 30,000 patient-years) but serious. Risk increases with kidney failure, liver disease, severe dehydration, excessive alcohol, or acute illness.

**Contraindications:**
- **Absolute:** eGFR <30, acute/unstable heart failure, hepatic failure, metabolic acidosis, active alcohol abuse
- **Relative:** eGFR 30-45 (reduce dose), upcoming surgery (hold), heavy alcohol use

**Drug Interactions:**
| Interacting Drug | Effect | Action |
|------------------|--------|--------|
| IV Contrast | Increased lactic acidosis risk | Hold 48h before/after |
| Alcohol (excessive) | Increased lactic acidosis risk | Limit to 1-2 drinks/day |
| NSAIDs (chronic) | May reduce renal function | Monitor eGFR, avoid if possible |
| Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors | Increased acidosis risk | Monitor |
| Cationic drugs (cimetidine, etc.) | Compete for tubular secretion | Monitor |

### FOLLOW-UP

**Review Timeline:**
- **When:** [Week 1 phone check → Week 2-4 titration → Month 3 A1c recheck]
- **What:** GI tolerance, adherence, glucose logs, A1c
- **Who:** MD/NP/PA for titration; RN/PharmD for tolerance checks
- **Where:** Phone/telehealth for early checks; lab for A1c

**Monitoring Schedule:**
- **Week 1:** Phone check-in on GI tolerance
- **Week 2:** If tolerating, advance to next tier
- **Week 4:** Office/telehealth visit, review glucose logs
- **Month 3:** A1c recheck, comprehensive assessment
- **Ongoing:** A1c every 3-6 months, annual B12, renal function q3-12 months

**Action Based on Results:**

| Result | Action |
|--------|--------|
| A1c at goal, tolerating well | Continue current therapy, maintain lifestyle |
| A1c still elevated despite max dose | Add second agent (consider GLP-1 or SGLT2) |
| A1c at goal but GI intolerable | Switch to Metformin ER (extended-release) |
| eGFR declining | Reassess dose; if <30, discontinue |
| B12 low | Supplement with B12 1000mcg daily |

## 🚀 INITIATION GUIDE

> **Phase 1: Getting Started** (Days 1-14)

### Prerequisites:
- [ ] Diagnosis of Type 2 Diabetes confirmed
- [ ] Baseline labs: A1c, eGFR/Cr, LFTs
- [ ] eGFR ≥30 (≥45 preferred for full dosing)
- [ ] No active contraindications
- [ ] Glucose meter and supplies obtained (if home monitoring planned)

### Getting Started:

**Day 1:**
- Fill prescription at pharmacy
- Read this card completely (~5 minutes)
- Take first dose WITH dinner (food is critical!)
- Log in app that you started

**Days 2-7:**
- Take medication with breakfast AND dinner
- Always eat when you take it
- Expect some stomach upset - this is normal and usually temporary
- Keep crackers nearby in case of nausea
- Log any side effects in app

**Days 8-14:**
- Side effects should be improving
- If tolerating well, provider may increase dose
- Start checking fasting glucose if instructed
- Building the habit - consistency matters more than perfection

### Starting Parameters (Conservative):
- **Dose:** 500mg with dinner only (if GI-sensitive) OR 500mg BID (standard)
- **Timing:** With meals - non-negotiable for tolerability
- **Monitoring:** Daily fasting glucose if home monitoring planned

### Common Early Challenges:

| Challenge | Solution |
|-----------|----------|
| Upset stomach/nausea | Take WITH food (not after), eat slowly, smaller meals |
| Diarrhea | Usually improves by week 2-4; ensure taking with food |
| Metallic taste | Temporary; try sugar-free mints |
| Forgetting doses | Set phone alarms, use pill organizer, anchor to meals |
| "It's not working" | Takes 2-4 weeks for glucose effect, 3 months for full A1c impact |

### Contact Your Care Team If:
- Severe stomach pain or vomiting
- Diarrhea that doesn't improve after 2 weeks
- Signs of lactic acidosis (see RED warnings above)
- You're unsure about anything

---

## ⚙️ MAINTENANCE GUIDE

> **Phase 2: Staying on Track** (Day 15 - Goal Achievement)

### Daily Actions:
1. Take metformin with breakfast and dinner
2. Log adherence in app (takes 10 seconds)
3. Check fasting glucose per schedule (if monitoring)
4. Note any concerns or side effects

### AI Monitoring (Automatic):
- **Adherence tracking:** Target 80%+ over rolling 14 days
- **Glucose trend analysis:** Flagging if values consistently out of range
- **Refill reminders:** Alert when prescription running low
- **Lab due reminders:** A1c, renal function per schedule

### Adjustment Triggers:

**Ready to Increase Dose If:**
- Adherence >80% for 2+ weeks
- GI side effects resolved or minimal
- A1c or fasting glucose still above goal
- Current dose is below target (1000mg BID)

**Consider Decreasing If:**
- GI side effects limiting tolerability despite strategies
- eGFR declining (30-45 range: max 1000mg/day)
- Hypoglycemia occurring (rare with metformin alone; check for other causes)

**Hold Metformin If:**
- Acute illness with dehydration, vomiting, or diarrhea
- Scheduled for IV contrast imaging
- Upcoming surgery
- Resume when: Eating normally, well-hydrated, 48h post-contrast

**Add Second Agent If:**
- A1c still >goal after 3 months on max tolerated metformin dose
- Common additions: SGLT2 inhibitor (Jardiance, Farxiga) or GLP-1 (Ozempic, Trulicity)

### Scheduled Reviews:
- **Weekly (first month):** App check-in on adherence/tolerance
- **Monthly:** Brief provider touchpoint
- **Quarterly:** A1c recheck, comprehensive review
- **Annually:** Full diabetes assessment, B12 level, eye exam, foot exam

### Troubleshooting:

**If Struggling with Adherence:**
- AI asks: "What's getting in the way?"
- Options: Simplify to once daily ER formulation, adjust timing, address barriers
- Patient can request: Consultation, medication change

**If GI Side Effects Persist >4 Weeks:**
- Switch to Metformin ER (extended-release) - much better GI tolerance
- Or reduce dose and re-titrate more slowly

**If A1c Not Improving Despite Good Adherence:**
- Verify timing (with meals?)
- Consider adding second agent
- Review diet/lifestyle factors

## 🎯 DE-LOADING / DE-PRESCRIBING GUIDE

> **Phase 3: Completing Your Journey** (When Criteria Met)

### Three Exit Pathways:

#### 🎓 PATHWAY A: GRADUATION (Rare for Metformin)
*"Your diabetes has resolved"*

**Criteria (all must be met):**
- [ ] A1c <5.7% (non-diabetic range) for 6+ months
- [ ] Significant lifestyle changes sustained (weight loss, diet, exercise)
- [ ] No other diabetes medications
- [ ] Provider assessment confirms remission

**Process:**
1. Gradual taper over 1-3 months (not abrupt stop)
2. Increased glucose monitoring during taper
3. A1c recheck 3 months after stopping
4. If A1c rises >6.5%, restart metformin

**Outcome:** Card moves to "Completed - Diabetes Remission" 🎉

**Note:** True diabetes remission is uncommon but possible, especially with significant weight loss (bariatric surgery, intensive lifestyle intervention).

---

#### 🔄 PATHWAY B: TRANSITION
*"Switching to a different approach"*

**Switch to Metformin ER If:**
- GI side effects intolerable on IR formulation
- Patient prefers once-daily dosing
- Action: Discontinue IR, start ER at equivalent total daily dose

**Add Second Agent If:**
- A1c not at goal on max metformin
- CV or renal benefit desired (SGLT2i, GLP-1)
- Action: Keep metformin, add new card

**Replace Metformin If:**
- Contraindication develops (eGFR <30, etc.)
- Intolerable despite ER formulation
- Action: Discontinue metformin, start alternative (e.g., SGLT2i monotherapy)

**Outcome:** Current card replaced/supplemented; new card begins Initiation phase

---

#### ⏹️ PATHWAY C: DISCONTINUATION
*"This medication must stop"*

**Criteria:**
- eGFR drops below 30 (absolute contraindication)
- Lactic acidosis event
- Severe, intolerable adverse effects despite interventions
- Patient informed refusal (document discussion)

**Process:**
1. Can stop immediately (no taper required for metformin)
2. Discuss alternative diabetes management
3. Increase monitoring during transition
4. Document reason for discontinuation

**Outcome:** Card archived with outcome note; alternative therapy initiated

---

### Autonomy Level:

| Action | Who Decides? |
|--------|--------------|
| Temporary hold (sick day, contrast) | Patient self-directed with education |
| Dose adjustment within prescribed range | Patient + AI guidance, provider notified |
| Switching IR → ER | Provider approval (same medication, different form) |
| Adding second agent | Provider required |
| Discontinuing for intolerance | Provider approval recommended |
| Discontinuing for contraindication | Provider required |
| Stopping for "remission" | Provider required + close monitoring |

---

### De-Prescribing Messaging Templates:

**Remission Message (Rare):**
```
🎓 Amazing news! Your diabetes appears to be in remission!
