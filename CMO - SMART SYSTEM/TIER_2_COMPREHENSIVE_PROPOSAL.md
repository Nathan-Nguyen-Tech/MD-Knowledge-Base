# TIER 2 COMPREHENSIVE PROPOSAL - Revised Card Types

## Executive Summary

The current Tier 2 structure has **10 card types** but is missing several critical intervention categories that are essential for comprehensive health management. This proposal expands Tier 2 to **16 card types** organized under 2 Tier 1 categories.

---

## Current State (10 Types) - Gaps Identified

### Medical Cards (5 types)
✅ Medications
✅ Labs/Tests
✅ Imaging
✅ Procedures
✅ Referrals

### Behavioral Cards (5 types)
✅ Nutrition
✅ Movement
✅ Recovery (Sleep/Stress)
✅ Mind-Body
✅ Micro-Learning

### Critical Gaps
❌ **Environmental/Social Determinants** - Air quality, housing, community, relationships, occupational
❌ **Medical Equipment/Devices** - CPAP, monitors, assistive devices (different from procedures)
❌ **Supplements/OTC** - Vitamins, minerals, herbs (different from prescription meds)
❌ **Behavioral Health Services** - Therapy, counseling (currently buried in referrals)
❌ **Monitoring/Self-Tracking** - Home monitoring equipment and tracking behaviors
❌ **Substance Use/Harm Reduction** - Smoking, alcohol, drugs (currently scattered)

## PROPOSED TIER 2 STRUCTURE (16 Types)

### TIER 1: MEDICAL CARDS (9 Types)

#### 1. 💊 **MEDICATIONS** (~300 cards)
**Definition**: Prescription pharmaceuticals ordered by clinician
- All prescription drugs across therapeutic classes
- Requires prescription
- **Does NOT include**: OTC vitamins/supplements (see Supplements type)

**Examples**: Lisinopril, Metformin, Sertraline

---

#### 2. 🔬 **LABS/TESTS** (~90 cards)
**Definition**: Laboratory tests requiring specimen collection
- Blood, urine, stool, other specimens
- Requires provider order
- Includes point-of-care testing

**Examples**: HbA1c, Lipid Panel, Urinalysis

---

#### 3. 🏥 **IMAGING STUDIES** (~50 cards)
**Definition**: Radiological and imaging diagnostics
- X-ray, CT, MRI, ultrasound, nuclear medicine
- Requires provider order
- May involve contrast or radiation

**Examples**: Chest X-ray, Abdominal CT, Brain MRI

---

#### 4. 🏥 **PROCEDURES** (~55 cards)
**Definition**: Medical procedures (diagnostic or therapeutic)
- Invasive or semi-invasive
- One-time or periodic
- Requires clinical skill/facility

**Examples**: Colonoscopy, Joint injection, Skin biopsy, Vaccinations

---

#### 5. 🩺 **MEDICAL DEVICES/EQUIPMENT** (~40 cards) **[NEW]**
**Definition**: Durable medical equipment for ongoing therapeutic use
- CPAP machines, oxygen concentrators
- Prosthetics, orthotics, assistive devices
- Requires prescription/order but patient uses independently
- **Different from monitoring devices** (see Monitoring type)

**Examples**: CPAP for sleep apnea, Home oxygen, Hearing aids, Walker, Wheelchair

**Rationale**: These are prescribed medical interventions but not medications or procedures. They're ongoing therapeutic devices.

---

#### 6. 📊 **MONITORING DEVICES/TRACKING** (~35 cards) **[NEW]**
**Definition**: Equipment and tools for home monitoring and self-tracking
- Blood pressure monitors, glucose meters
- Scales, pulse oximeters, thermometers
- Symptom diaries, tracking apps
- May or may not require prescription

**Examples**: Home BP monitor, Glucometer, Daily weight tracking, Symptom diary

**Rationale**: Critical for chronic disease management. Different from medical devices (therapeutic) and different from labs (not sent to facility). Patient self-monitors at home.

---

#### 7. 💊 **SUPPLEMENTS/OTC** (~50 cards) **[NEW]**
**Definition**: Over-the-counter vitamins, minerals, and supplements
- Vitamins, minerals, herbal supplements
- Evidence-based recommendations (not all supplements included)

**Rationale**: Mental health is critical. Currently buried in "Referrals" but deserves distinct category given prevalence and importance. Different from Mind-Body practices (which are self-directed).

---

#### 9. 👨‍⚕️ **SPECIALIST REFERRALS** (~30 cards)
**Definition**: Consultations with medical specialists
- All medical specialties
- Urgent vs routine

## RATIONALE FOR EACH NEW TYPE

### Medical Devices/Equipment (NEW)
**Why separate from Procedures?**
- Procedures are one-time or periodic events
- Devices are ongoing therapeutic interventions
- Different adherence patterns (daily use vs periodic visits)
- Different barriers (equipment maintenance, supplies)

**Examples**: CPAP (sleep apnea), oxygen (COPD), hearing aids (hearing loss), wheelchair (mobility)

### Monitoring Devices/Tracking (NEW)
**Why separate from Labs?**
- Labs are sent to facility; monitoring is patient self-directed at home
- Real-time feedback vs periodic results
- Different skill set (patient must learn to use device)
- Critical for chronic disease management (diabetes, HTN, CHF)

**Examples**: Home BP monitor, glucometer, daily weights, symptom diary

### Supplements/OTC (NEW)
**Why separate from Medications?**
- No prescription required
- Different evidence base (often lower quality)
- Different insurance coverage (usually patient pays)
- Different safety profile (fewer drug interactions)
- Very commonly recommended by clinicians

**Examples**: Vitamin D, calcium, omega-3s, probiotics, fiber supplements

### Behavioral Health Services (NEW)
**Why separate from Referrals?**
- Mental health is critical and prevalent (~1 in 5 adults)
- Ongoing services (not one-time consult like typical referral)
- Different from self-directed mind-body practices
- Needs distinct tracking for sessions, adherence, outcomes

**Examples**: CBT for anxiety, DBT for borderline personality, Support groups, Family therapy

### Environmental/Social Health (NEW)
**Why essential?**
- **Social determinants drive 80% of health outcomes**
- Air quality affects respiratory and cardiovascular health
- Social connection reduces mortality (equal to smoking cessation!)
- Housing quality impacts multiple conditions (asthma, injuries, mental health)
- Occupational health addresses back pain, stress, repetitive injuries
- Evidence-based interventions but currently no home in system

**Examples**:
- Social: Join walking group, volunteer, strengthen relationships
- Environmental: Air purifier, reduce home allergens, test for radon
- Occupational: Ergonomic desk setup, take movement breaks
- Community: Access green spaces, improve neighborhood walkability

### Substance Use/Harm Reduction (NEW)
**Why separate?**
- Extremely prevalent:
  - Smoking: 12% of adults
  - Alcohol use disorder: 5% of adults
  - Other substances: 3-4% of adults
- High impact across ALL health systems
- Currently scattered across multiple types (medications, referrals, behavioral)
- Deserves focused attention for screening, intervention, tracking

**Examples**: Smoking cessation (varenicline + counseling), alcohol reduction, harm reduction strategies

---

## QUESTIONS FOR CONSIDERATION

1. Should **Supplements/OTC** be Medical or Behavioral?
   - **Current placement**: Medical (clinician-recommended, evidence-based)
   - **Alternative**: Behavioral (patient-initiated, OTC)
   - **Recommendation**: Keep in Medical (evidence-based, often monitored)

2. Should **Monitoring/Tracking** be Medical or Behavioral?
   - **Current placement**: Medical (devices often prescribed, disease management)
   - **Alternative**: Behavioral (patient self-directed)
   - **Recommendation**: Keep in Medical (critical for clinical decision-making)

3. Should we further split **Environmental/Social Health**?
   - Could separate into: Environmental Health (air, housing) vs Social Health (relationships, community)
   - **Recommendation**: Keep combined initially; use Tier 4 to separate subcategories

4. Any other card types missing?
   - Sexual health?
   - Financial health/resource navigation?
   - Spiritual/religious practices?
   - **Recommendation**: Sexual health → Behavioral Health Services; Financial → Environmental/Social; Spiritual → Mind-Body

---

**This proposal expands Tier 2 from 10 to 16 card types, adding critical intervention categories that address social determinants, mental health, substance use, and monitoring - all essential for comprehensive, holistic care.**
