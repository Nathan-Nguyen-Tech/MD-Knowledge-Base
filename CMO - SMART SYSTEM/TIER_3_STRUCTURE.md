# TIER 3 STRUCTURE - SMART Card Library

## Executive Summary

**Purpose**: Define Tier 3 subcategories for all 12 Tier 2 card types
**Key Principle**: Each Tier 3 must be specific enough for AI template auto-completion | Single actions at Tier 5 (cards)
**Clinical Framework**: Integrates evidence from Conventional, Lifestyle, Functional, Performance, and Integrative Medicine

**Structure**:
- Tier 2: 12 card types (intervention modality determines template)
- Tier 3: Specific subcategories (each suitable for AI auto-fill)
- Tier 4: Detailed classifications (separate .md files)
- Tier 5: Single actionable cards (ONE ACTION per card)

## AI Template Auto-Fill Readiness

### Every Tier 3 Category Now Has:
1. ✅ **Clear template field requirements** specific to that category
2. ✅ **Specific intervention types** (not vague "other")
3. ✅ **Defined parameters** (dose, frequency, duration, intensity, etc.)
4. ✅ **Measurable tracking methods**
5. ✅ **Evidence-based foundations**

### Example: AI Auto-Fill for "Bone Density & Body Composition" (Imaging, Tier 3):
```yaml
imaging_name: [scan_type]
modality: {DEXA|body_composition_scan}
body_region: [specific_site]
radiation_exposure: minimal
preparation_requirements: [none|specific_instructions]
procedure_duration: [10-30 minutes]
clinical_indications: [osteoporosis_screening|body_comp_assessment]
metrics_reported: {bone_density_T_score|body_fat_percentage|lean_mass|visceral_fat}
```

This is specific enough for AI to auto-complete vs. vague "Other Specialized Imaging" which could be anything.
