## Card Naming Convention

**Format**: `IMG_[MODALITY]_[NUMBER]`

**Modality Abbreviations**:
- `XR` = X-Ray
- `CT` = CT Scan
- `MRI` = MRI
- `US` = Ultrasound
- `ECHO` = Echocardiography
- `MAMM` = Mammography
- `NUC` = Nuclear Medicine

---

## Notes

1. **Contrast considerations**: Include creatinine/eGFR requirements, allergy history, metformin hold
2. **Radiation exposure**: Include relative radiation doses for patient education
3. **Pregnancy**: Specify contraindications (CT/X-ray) vs safe options (US, MRI without contrast)
4. **Prior authorization**: Many advanced imaging requires PA - note in cards
5. **Not included**: Interventional radiology procedures (see Procedures), PET scans (oncology)

---

## Clinical Pearls for Card Development

1. **CT Head Cards**: Include stroke window timing, contrast vs non-contrast decision
2. **Chest X-Ray Cards**: Include 2-view vs 1-view indications
3. **MRI Cards**: Include contraindications (pacemakers, metal), claustrophobia alternatives
4. **Ultrasound Cards**: Include prep instructions (fasting, full bladder)
5. **Mammogram Cards**: Include screening guidelines by age, dense breast notification
6. **DEXA Cards**: Include T-score interpretation, recheck intervals
