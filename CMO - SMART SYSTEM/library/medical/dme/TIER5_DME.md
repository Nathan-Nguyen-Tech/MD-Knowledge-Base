## Notes

1. **Insurance coverage**: Medicare DME requires specific criteria documentation
2. **Prior authorization**: Most DME requires PA and medical necessity documentation
3. **Maintenance**: Include cleaning, replacement schedules, troubleshooting
4. **Training**: Many devices require patient education on proper use
5. **Supplies**: Consumables (tubing, masks, test strips) need regular reordering

---

## Clinical Pearls for Card Development

1. **CPAP Cards**: Include AHI requirements for coverage, compliance tracking, mask fitting tips
2. **Oxygen Cards**: Include qualifying criteria (SpO2 <88%), liter flow settings, safety (no smoking)
3. **Wheelchair Cards**: Include face-to-face encounter requirements, home accessibility
4. **CGM Cards**: Include calibration requirements, sensor change frequency, app connectivity
5. **Compression Stocking Cards**: Include proper sizing, graduated compression levels, donning techniques
