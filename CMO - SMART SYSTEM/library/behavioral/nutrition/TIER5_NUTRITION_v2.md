# Tier 5 Enumeration: Nutrition (v2.0 - CORRECTED)

> **Location in Hierarchy**:
> Tier 1: Behavioral > Tier 2: Nutrition > Tier 3: [Category] > Tier 4: [Specific] > **Tier 5: Individual Cards**

---

## CRITICAL CHANGES IN v2.0

**What Changed:**
1. **Removed "diet pattern" cards** - Mediterranean Diet, DASH Diet, etc. are DECKS, not cards
2. **Each card = ONE specific food/behavior action**
3. **Patient can do this action independently with one clear instruction**

**Rule**: A nutrition card answers: "What ONE food-related action should I do right now?"

**Clarification on Diet Patterns**:
- "Mediterranean Diet" = A DECK containing cards like "Eat fatty fish", "Use olive oil", "Eat vegetables", etc.
- Individual cards from this library are assembled into condition-specific decks

---

**Total Cards**: 168 cards

**Action Types Included**:
- Treatment/Intervention (food actions, behaviors)
