## USAGE NOTE

Micro-learning cards are **not prescribed standalone**. They are embedded within condition-specific decks to provide foundational knowledge before patients take action. For example:

```
Hypertension Management Deck:
├── Card 1: 📚 Micro-Learning: Understanding Your BP Numbers
│   └── Unlocks → Card 2: Take Lisinopril
├── Card 2: 💊 Action: Take Lisinopril daily
│   └── Includes mini-lesson on how ACE inhibitors work
└── [More cards...]
```

This structure ensures education happens **through doing**, not before doing.
