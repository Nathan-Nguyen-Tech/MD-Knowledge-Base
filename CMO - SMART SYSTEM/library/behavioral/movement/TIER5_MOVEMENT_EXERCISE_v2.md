# Tier 5 Enumeration: Movement/Exercise (v2.0 - CORRECTED)

> **Location in Hierarchy**:
> Tier 1: Behavioral > Tier 2: Movement/Exercise > Tier 3: [Type] > Tier 4: [Specific] > **Tier 5: Individual Cards**

---

## CRITICAL CHANGES IN v2.0

**What Changed:**
1. **Removed all "routine/program" items** - Those are DECKS, not cards
2. **Removed duration/intensity variants** - Template handles customization
3. **Each card = ONE specific atomic movement/exercise**
4. **Patient can do this action independently**

**Rule**: If you can't describe it in one verb + one object, it's not a card.

---

## Overview

This document enumerates ALL individual Tier 5 cards for Movement and Exercise interventions. Each entry represents ONE SMART card - a single, specific, atomic exercise that patients can perform.

**Total Cards**: 127 cards
