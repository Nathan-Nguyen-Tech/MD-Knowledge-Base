## PILLAR DEFINITION

**Emotion Pillar** covers mental health, stress management, mood regulation, cognitive techniques, and psychological wellbeing.

**Rule**: An Emotion card answers: "What ONE specific mental/psychological technique should I do right now?"

**Placement Logic**:
- If it targets MENTAL/PSYCHOLOGICAL state (mood, thoughts, emotions) → Emotion
- If it targets PHYSICAL restoration (sleep, body) → Recovery
- If it involves EXTERNAL factors or other people → Environment
