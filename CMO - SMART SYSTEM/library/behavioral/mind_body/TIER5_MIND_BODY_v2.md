## CRITICAL CHANGES IN v2.0

**What Changed:**
1. **Each card = ONE specific mind-body practice/technique**
2. **Removed vague items** like "Meditation Practice" - must specify WHICH technique
3. **Patient can do this action independently**

**Rule**: A mind-body card answers: "What ONE specific practice should I do right now?"
