## CRITICAL CHANGES IN v2.0

**What Changed:**
1. **Each card = ONE specific recovery action**
2. **Patient can do this action independently**
3. **Clear, checkable behavior** (not vague like "practice good sleep hygiene")

**Rule**: A recovery card answers: "What ONE specific thing should I do right now for rest/recovery?"
