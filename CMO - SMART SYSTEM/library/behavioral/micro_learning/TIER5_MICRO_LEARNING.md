## Card Naming Convention

**Format**: `LEARN_[TOPIC]_[NUMBER]`

- `EX` = Exercise
- `MED` = Medications
- `GEN` = General Health

---

## Notes

1. **Duration**: All micro-learning cards should be consumable in ~5 minutes
2. **No jargon**: Use plain language, define medical terms
3. **Visuals**: Cards should include simple diagrams/infographics
4. **Knowledge check**: Consider including 1-2 simple questions to verify understanding
5. **Links**: Connect to related action cards (e.g., "How statins work" → Statin medication card)

---

## Clinical Pearls for Card Development

1. **Use analogies**: "Your heart is like a pump" makes concepts accessible
2. **Numbers in context**: "Your LDL is 150 - we want it below 100" is better than just defining LDL
3. **Why it matters**: Always connect to patient's health outcomes
4. **Action orientation**: End with "what you can do" to connect to action cards
5. **Prerequisite logic**: Note which cards unlock others (e.g., "Understanding carbs" before "Glycemic index")
