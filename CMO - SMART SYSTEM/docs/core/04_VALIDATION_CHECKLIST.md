| Complex | Simple (6th-8th grade) |
|---------|------------------------|
| Administer | Take / Give |
| Pharmaceutical | Medicine / Drug |
| Hypertension | High blood pressure |
| Hypotension | Low blood pressure |
| Utilize | Use |
| Physician | Doctor |
| Commence | Start / Begin |

**Sentence Shortening Examples**:

❌ "It is recommended that patients administer this pharmaceutical agent with food in order to minimize gastrointestinal adverse effects."

✅ "Take this medicine with food. This helps prevent stomach upset."

### FEASIBILITY SCORING GUIDE (0-100%)

**Base Score**: 100%

**Deduction Guidelines**:

| Barrier Type | Deduction | Example |
|--------------|-----------|---------|
| No insurance coverage | -25% | Expensive imaging not covered |
| High cost (>$100/month) | -20% | Brand-name only medication |
| Equipment not accessible | -15% | Home dialysis machine |
| Transportation barriers | -15% | Weekly PT in distant location |
| Time intensive (>30 min/day) | -10% | Complex meal prep |
| Complex instructions (>5 steps) | -10% | Multi-step wound care |
| Language barriers | -15% | No translation available |
| Literacy mismatch | -10% | College-level materials |
| Previous failure | -20% | Patient tried and couldn't sustain |
| Contraindication/allergy | -100% | Card not offered |

**Booster Guidelines**:

| Facilitator | Addition | Example |
|-------------|----------|---------|
| Previous similar success | +15% | Successfully used similar med |
| Patient specifically requested | +20% | Patient motivated, asked for this |
| Low time burden (<10 min/day) | +10% | Simple daily pill |

**Score Interpretation**:
- **90-100%**: Highly feasible - recommend strongly
- **70-89%**: Feasible with support - discuss barriers
- **50-69%**: Challenging - need barrier mitigation plan
- **<50%**: Low feasibility - strongly consider alternatives
