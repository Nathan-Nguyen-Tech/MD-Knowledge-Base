#### FULL CLINICAL VIEW

**WHAT**
- **Card Name**: Lisinopril 10mg Daily
- **Card Type**: Medication (Tier 2) > Prescription Medications (Tier 3) > ACE Inhibitors (Tier 4)
- **Generic Name**: Lisinopril
- **Brand Names**: Prinivil, Zestril
- **Dose**: 10 mg
- **Formulation**: Oral tablet
- **Route**: PO (oral)
- **Frequency**: Once daily
- **Duration**: Ongoing (chronic therapy)

**WHO**
- **Primary Actor**: Patient (self-administers)
- **Support Actors**:
  - MD/NP/PA (prescribes, adjusts dose)
  - Pharmacist (dispenses, counsels)
  - Caregiver/Family (reminds, monitors)
- **Target Population**: Adults with hypertension

**Special Considerations**:
- Geriatric: Start at lower dose (2.5-5mg), monitor for orthostatic hypotension
- Renal Impairment: Reduce dose if CrCl <30 mL/min; monitor K+ closely
- Hepatic Impairment: No adjustment needed
- Pregnancy: Category D - CONTRAINDICATED (causes fetal harm)
- Breastfeeding: Use with caution; consider alternatives

**WHEN**
- **Frequency**: Once daily
- **Duration**: Ongoing (lifelong for most patients)
- **Best Time**: Morning (consistent timing more important than specific time)
- **Missed Dose**: Take as soon as remembered; skip if close to next dose; never double up
- **Start Date**: [Per clinician order]

**Titration Tiers** (within same card):
- Tier 1: 5mg daily (starting dose for sensitive patients)
- Tier 2: 10mg daily (standard starting dose) - CURRENT
- Tier 3: 20mg daily (if BP not at goal after 2-4 weeks)
- Tier 4: 40mg daily (maximum dose)

**WHERE**
- **Setting**: Home (daily self-administration)
- **Location-Specific**: Store at room temperature, away from moisture
- **Access**: Any pharmacy with valid prescription

**WHY**

**Clinical Goal** (Performance Medicine Framework):
- **Cardiovascular System: Reduce Risk**
- Secondary: Filtration/Urinary System: Protect Function (nephroprotection)

**Patient's Personal Goal**:
"I want to avoid a stroke like my father had. I want to stay healthy for my grandchildren."

**Connection**:
Controlling blood pressure directly reduces stroke risk by 35-40%. By taking this medication consistently, you're protecting yourself from the same fate as your father.

**Mechanism of Action**:
Lisinopril blocks angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), which reduces angiotensin II production. This causes blood vessels to relax and widen, lowering blood pressure. It also reduces strain on the heart and protects kidney function.

**Evidence**:
- Source: ACC/AHA 2017 Hypertension Guidelines, updated 2023
- Grade: **A** (Multiple high-quality RCTs, consistent findings)
- Summary: ACE inhibitors reduce cardiovascular events by 20-25% in hypertensive patients; first-line therapy for patients with diabetes, CKD, or heart failure.

**Expected Timeline (Time-to-Benefit)**:
You should notice: Blood pressure improvement in about 1-2 weeks. Maximum effect in 4-6 weeks.

**DISCLAIMER**: These timelines are based on average patient outcomes. Your individual results may vary based on adherence, your body's response, other health conditions, medications, and lifestyle factors. If you're not seeing improvement in the expected timeframe, contact your care team.

**HOW**

**Detailed Step-by-Step Instructions**:
1. Take one 10mg tablet by mouth every morning
2. Swallow whole with a full glass of water (8 oz)
3. May take with or without food (food does not affect absorption)
4. Take at the same time each day for best results
5. Do not crush, chew, or break the tablet
6. Store at room temperature (68-77°F), away from moisture and heat

**Synergy Tips** (Do This WITH...):
- Pair with: Home BP Monitoring card (check BP before taking medication)
- Stacks well with: DASH Diet card (dietary changes amplify medication effect)
- Time-Saving Combo: Take with breakfast routine for consistency

**MEASURE**

**Tracking Method**:
- Primary: Blood pressure (systolic/diastolic in mmHg)
- Secondary: Heart rate, symptoms (dizziness, cough), adherence

**Frequency**:
- BP: Daily (morning before medication) for first month, then 2-3x/week
- Labs: BMP at baseline, 4 weeks, then every 6 months

**Tools Needed**:
- Upper arm blood pressure cuff (validated device, ~$30-50)
- BP tracking app or logbook
- Pill organizer (optional but recommended)

**TARGET**

**Primary Goal**:
- Systolic BP: <130 mmHg
- Diastolic BP: <80 mmHg

**Timeline**: Achieve goal BP within 3 months of starting therapy

**Success Criteria**:
- BP at goal on ≥80% of readings
- No significant side effects
- Labs remain stable (K+ 3.5-5.0, Cr stable)
- Patient reports good adherence

**SAFETY**

**🟡 YELLOW - Common Side Effects** (Monitor, usually can continue):
- Dry cough (5-10%) - may persist; switch to ARB if intolerable
- Dizziness (3-5%) - usually improves; rise slowly from sitting
- Headache (3-4%) - usually mild and temporary

### DECK SYNERGY ANALYSIS

**How Cards Work Together**:

```
Lisinopril (Card 1)         →  10-15 mmHg ↓
    +
DASH Diet (Card 3)          →  8-14 mmHg ↓
    +
Low Sodium (<2000mg)        →  4-8 mmHg ↓
    +
Walking (Card 4)            →  5-8 mmHg ↓
    +
Stress Management (Card 6)  →  4-6 mmHg ↓
═══════════════════════════════════════════
CUMULATIVE EFFECT:             31-51 mmHg ↓

BP Monitoring (Card 2)      →  Tracks all of above
BMP Lab (Card 5)            →  Ensures safety
Follow-Up (Card 7)          →  Coordinates care

### What AI Extracted

**From Clinical Note → To Card Components**:

1. **Medications**:
   - Extracted: "Lisinopril 10mg PO daily"
   - Generated: Full medication card with dosing, monitoring, safety

2. **Lifestyle Interventions**:
   - Extracted: "Low sodium diet <2000mg/day"
   - Generated: Nutrition card with meal plans, food lists, tracking

3. **Monitoring**:
   - Extracted: "Home BP monitoring BID"
   - Generated: Vital monitoring card with technique, device, frequency

4. **Labs**:
   - Extracted: "labs (BMP) in 4 weeks"
   - Generated: Lab card with preparation, interpretation, follow-up

5. **Behavioral**:
   - Extracted: "Teach deep breathing exercises... 5 min twice daily"
   - Generated: Behavioral card with technique, timing, benefits

6. **Patient Goals**:
   - Extracted from HPI and FHx: Father's stroke, work stress
   - Incorporated into WHY sections: "Avoid stroke like my father"

### AI Auto-Population Details

For each card, AI automatically filled in:

✅ Evidence citations (ACC/AHA guidelines for HTN)
✅ Safety warnings by health system
✅ Standard dosing and monitoring
✅ Reading level (6th-8th grade for patient-facing)
✅ Feasibility scores based on patient profile
✅ Synergy tips (how cards work together)
✅ Follow-up schedule

**Result**: Clinician spends 2 minutes reviewing instead of 10 minutes manually creating cards.

## KEY FEATURES DEMONSTRATED

These examples show:

1. **Visual-First Design**: Complete mockups before structured content
2. **Two-Sided Architecture**: Simple front, detailed back
3. **Performance Medicine**: Clinical goals linked to 8 health systems
4. **Plain Language**: 6th-8th grade reading level on patient side
5. **Safety by Systems**: Organized warnings
6. **Evidence-Based**: Citations with grades
7. **Actionable**: Clear, measurable steps
8. **Progress Tracking**: Visual indicators of adherence
9. **Deck Synergy**: How multiple cards work together
10. **AI Automation**: Natural language parsing from clinical notes

## USING THESE EXAMPLES

### When Creating a Single Card:
1. Start with visual mockup (Example 1)
2. Follow universal template (File 02)
3. Use type-specific guidance (File 03)
4. Validate with checklist (File 04)

### When Creating a Deck:
1. Review deck principles (File 10)
2. Study comprehensive deck example (Example 2 above)
3. Ensure synergy between cards
4. Calculate total time burden and feasibility

### When Implementing AI Features:
1. Study clinical note parsing (Example 3 above)
2. Review AI workflow details (File 06)
3. Implement NLP extraction logic
4. Build card auto-population from templates
