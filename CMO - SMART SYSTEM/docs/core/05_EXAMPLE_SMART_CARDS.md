### CARD 1: 💊 Lisinopril 10mg Daily

**Quick Summary**:
- Primary BP-lowering medication
- Expected effect: 10-15 mmHg reduction
- Take once daily in morning
- Monitor for dry cough (5-10% of patients)

**Synergy**: Works best when combined with Cards 2 (monitoring), 3 (low sodium), and 4 (DASH diet)

---

### CARD 2: 📊 Home Blood Pressure Monitoring

**Quick Summary**:
- Check BP twice daily (morning and evening)
- Track effectiveness of treatment
- Tools needed: Upper arm BP cuff (~$30-50 one-time)
- Record readings in app or logbook

**Synergy**: Essential for titrating Card 1 (medication) dosage

---

### CARD 3: 🥗 DASH Diet

**Quick Summary**:
- Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension
- Expected effect: 8-14 mmHg reduction
- Focus: High fruits/vegetables, low sodium
- Time: 2-3 hours meal prep weekly

**Key Changes**:
- 8-10 servings fruits/vegetables daily
- Whole grains instead of refined
- Lean proteins (fish, poultry)
- Low-fat dairy
- Limit sodium to <2,300mg (ideally <1,500mg)

**Synergy**: Amplifies Card 1 (medication) effects; natural fit with Card 5 (walking) for overall cardiovascular health

---

### CARD 4: 🏃 Walking Exercise Program

**Quick Summary**:
- Start: 10 minutes, 3x/week
- Build to: 30 minutes, 5x/week
- Expected effect: 5-8 mmHg reduction
- Intensity: Moderate (can talk but not sing)

**Progression Tiers**:
- Tier 1 (Weeks 1-2): 10 min, 3x/week, RPE 3-4
- Tier 2 (Weeks 3-6): 20 min, 4x/week, RPE 5-6
- Tier 3 (Ongoing): 30 min, 5x/week, RPE 6-7

**Synergy**: Complements Card 3 (DASH diet) for weight management and cardiovascular fitness

---

### CARD 5: 🔬 Basic Metabolic Panel (BMP) Lab

**Quick Summary**:
- Blood test to monitor kidney function and potassium
- Frequency: Baseline, Week 4, then every 6 months
- Why: Lisinopril can affect K+ and creatinine
- Fasting: Not required

**What's Being Checked**:
- Potassium (K+): Should stay 3.5-5.0 mEq/L
- Creatinine (Cr): Monitor kidney function
- Sodium (Na): Confirm dietary changes working

**Synergy**: Safety monitoring for Card 1 (medication); validates effectiveness of Card 3 (low sodium diet)

---

### CARD 6: 🧘 Stress Management - Deep Breathing

**Quick Summary**:
- 4-7-8 breathing technique
- Practice 5 minutes, twice daily
- Expected effect: 4-6 mmHg reduction
- Helps manage stress-related BP spikes

**Technique**:
1. Breathe in through nose for 4 counts
2. Hold breath for 7 counts
3. Exhale through mouth for 8 counts
4. Repeat 4 cycles

**Synergy**: Reduces acute stress responses that can spike BP; complements all other cards by improving overall stress management

---

### CARD 7: 📅 Follow-Up Visit Schedule

**Quick Summary**:
- Week 2: Phone call (tolerance check)
- Week 4: Office visit (BP check, medication adjustment if needed)
- Month 3: Office visit + labs
- Every 6 months: Routine monitoring

**Synergy**: Ensures all cards are working together; allows for timely adjustments

---

### DECK SYNERGY ANALYSIS

**How Cards Work Together**:

```
Lisinopril (Card 1)         →  10-15 mmHg ↓
    +
DASH Diet (Card 3)          →  8-14 mmHg ↓
    +
Low Sodium (<2000mg)        →  4-8 mmHg ↓
    +
Walking (Card 4)            →  5-8 mmHg ↓
    +
Stress Management (Card 6)  →  4-6 mmHg ↓
═══════════════════════════════════════════
CUMULATIVE EFFECT:             31-51 mmHg ↓

BP Monitoring (Card 2)      →  Tracks all of above
BMP Lab (Card 5)            →  Ensures safety
Follow-Up (Card 7)          →  Coordinates care
```
