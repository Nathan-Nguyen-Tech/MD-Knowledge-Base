# SMART CARD LIBRARY - TIER 1 OUTLINE

## Overview
The SMART Card Library is organized into 2 top-level categories (Tier 1 headers), representing the fundamental distinction between clinical/medical interventions and behavioral/lifestyle interventions.

**Total Estimated Cards**: ~1,000
**Tier 1 Categories**: 2
**Tier 2 Card Types**: 10 (5 under each Tier 1)
**Tier 3 Category Files**: ~18-20

## TIER 1 CATEGORIES (THE TOP-LEVEL HEADERS)

### 1. MEDICAL CARDS
**Definition**: Cards that require clinical prescription, medical supervision, or healthcare facility access. These represent traditional medical interventions including pharmacological treatments, diagnostic procedures, and specialist consultations.

**Scope**:
- Medications (prescription and some OTC when medically indicated)
- Laboratory tests and diagnostic procedures
- Imaging studies
- Medical procedures
- Specialist referrals

**Key Characteristics**:
- Typically require provider order or prescription
- May need insurance authorization
- Often have contraindications and drug interactions
- Require clinical monitoring
- Evidence-graded from medical literature

**Estimated Cards**: ~550-600

**Tier 2 Card Types Under Medical** (5):
1. Medications
2. Labs/Tests
3. Imaging
4. Procedures
5. Referrals

**Examples**:
- "Take Lisinopril 10mg daily"
- "Hemoglobin A1c blood test"
- "Chest X-ray"
- "Colonoscopy screening"
- "Cardiology consultation"

### 2. BEHAVIORAL CARDS
**Definition**: Cards representing actions patients can initiate themselves, focused on lifestyle modifications, self-management behaviors, and wellness practices. These are evidence-based interventions that don't require prescription but benefit from clinical guidance.

**Scope**:
- Nutrition and dietary changes
- Physical activity and exercise
- Sleep and recovery practices
- Stress management and mental health practices
- Brief educational content (micro-learning)

**Key Characteristics**:
- Patient can initiate without prescription
- Minimal to no cost (often free)
- Emphasize habit formation and adherence
- Often combined in "decks" for comprehensive lifestyle change
- Evidence-graded from behavioral science and nutrition research

**Estimated Cards**: ~400-450

**Tier 2 Card Types Under Behavioral** (5):
1. Nutrition
2. Movement
3. Recovery
4. Mind-Body Practices
5. Micro-Learning

**Examples**:
- "Follow Mediterranean diet pattern"
- "Walk 30 minutes, 5 days per week"
- "Practice 4-7-8 breathing for 5 minutes"
- "Maintain consistent sleep schedule"
- "Understanding your blood pressure numbers (5-min lesson)"

## RATIONALE FOR 2-TIER STRUCTURE

### Why Not 3 Tiers (with Education)?
**Historical context**: Earlier versions had "Educational Cards" as a third Tier 1 category. This was eliminated because:
- Education is not a standalone action (you don't "do education")
- Educational content is now embedded in every card's WHY/HOW sections
- Micro-learning cards (brief 5-minute lessons) exist within the Behavioral tier
- Reduces redundancy and confusion

### Medical vs Behavioral Distinction
This fundamental split aligns with:
- **Clinical workflow**: Medical cards = provider prescribes; Behavioral cards = patient initiates
- **Reimbursement models**: Medical = billable; Behavioral = wellness/prevention
- **Evidence sources**: Medical = clinical trials; Behavioral = behavioral science
- **Implementation barriers**: Medical = access to healthcare; Behavioral = motivation and habits

## CROSS-CUTTING ORGANIZATION

While the library is hierarchically organized Medical → Behavioral, the tagging system allows flexible filtering across categories:

**By Clinical Goal** (Performance Medicine Framework):
- Cardiovascular System: Reduce Risk
- Metabolic System: Improve Function
- [All 8 health systems × 3 domains]

**By Condition**:
- #Hypertension (includes medication + nutrition + exercise cards)
- #Diabetes (includes multiple medical + behavioral interventions)

**By Care Setting**:
- #Home (most behavioral cards, some medical monitoring)
- #Clinic (procedures, labs, imaging)
- #Telehealth (virtual visits, remote monitoring)

**By Evidence Grade**:
- #USPSTF_GradeA
- #ACC_AHA
- #ADA

This ensures cards can be found both hierarchically (browsing) and through flexible search/filtering (targeted lookup).
