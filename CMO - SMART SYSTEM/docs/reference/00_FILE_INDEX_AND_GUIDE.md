## 🎯 KEY ARCHITECTURAL CHANGES

### What Changed and Why

**1. Eliminated "Educational Cards" Category**
- **Why**: Education is a feature of every card, not a separate action
- **Now**: Educational content embedded in WHY/HOW sections of all cards
- **Benefit**: No passive learning; every card is actionable

**2. Created SMART Deck Library**
- **Why**: Replace traditional patient education materials (PDFs, printouts)
- **Now**: Condition-based decks with progressive, actionable cards
- **Benefit**: Patients learn by doing, not reading walls of text

**3. Introduced Micro-Learning Cards**
- **Why**: Some concepts need brief intro before action
- **Now**: Optional 5-minute learning cards within decks
- **Benefit**: Foundational knowledge without overwhelming

**4. Simplified Tier 1 Structure**
- **Why**: Medical vs Behavioral is clearest organizational principle
- **Now**: 2 categories instead of 3
- **Benefit**: Easier navigation, clearer mental model
