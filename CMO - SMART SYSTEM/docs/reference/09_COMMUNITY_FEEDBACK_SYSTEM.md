# COMMUNITY FEEDBACK & REVIEW SYSTEM

## Philosophy: Wisdom of the Crowd

**Core Belief**: Academic research provides the foundation, but real-world patient experience reveals implementation realities. Both are essential.

Balance evidence-based medicine with lived patient experience to create cards that are both clinically sound and practically achievable.

---

## PATIENT REVIEW PROCESS

### Step 1: Eligibility Requirements

**Minimum Requirements to Leave Review**:
- Enrolled in card for **at least 14 days**
- Attempted to complete the action at least once
- Verified patient identity (not spam/bots)

**Why 14 Days?**
- Ensures reviews based on actual experience, not initial impressions
- Allows time to encounter real barriers and benefits
- Filters out "quit on day 1" reviews

### Step 2: Patient Submits Review

**Review Components**:

#### A. Star Rating (Required)
```
⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Rate this card: [1-5 stars]

1 star = Very difficult, didn't help
2 stars = Challenging, minimal benefit
3 stars = Okay, some benefit
4 stars = Good, noticeable benefit
5 stars = Excellent, highly beneficial
```

#### B. Written Comment (Optional, 500 char max)
```
Share your experience (optional):
[Text box - 500 character limit]

Helpful prompts:
- What worked well for you?
- What challenges did you face?
- What advice would you give others?
```

#### C. Patient-Generated Tags (Select all that apply)
```
How would you describe this card?

Difficulty:
☐ #Easy
☐ #Moderate  
☐ #Challenging

Cost:
☐ #Affordable
☐ #ModeratelePriced
☐ #Expensive

Effectiveness:
☐ #WorkedForMe
☐ #SomeImprovement
☐ #DidntHelp

Support:
☐ #NeedsSupport (required help from others)
☐ #CanDoAlone

Time:
☐ #Quick (< 10 min/day)
☐ #Moderate (10-30 min/day)
☐ #TimeConsuming (> 30 min/day)

Other:
☐ #NeedsReminders
☐ #HardToStart
☐ #GotEasier
```

#### D. Outcome Report (Required)
```
Did you achieve your target goal?

○ Yes - I reached my goal
○ Partial - Some improvement but not at goal yet
○ No - Didn't reach goal
○ Too early to tell (< 4 weeks)
```

#### E. Adherence Self-Report (Required)
```
How often did you complete this action?

○ Daily (as prescribed)
○ Most days (80%+)
○ Sometimes (50-79%)
○ Rarely (< 50%)
○ Couldn't start
```

### Step 3: Review Moderation

**All reviews enter moderation queue before publication.**

#### Moderation Criteria

**Approved If**:
- ✅ Appropriate language (no profanity, hate speech)
- ✅ Relevant to the specific card
- ✅ Based on personal experience
- ✅ Constructive (even if negative)

**Rejected If**:
- ❌ Contains personal medical information (PHI)
- ❌ Spam or promotional content
- ❌ Offensive or discriminatory language
- ❌ Dangerous misinformation (e.g., "stopped taking heart meds and felt great")
- ❌ Not relevant to the card
- ❌ Duplicate submission

#### Moderation Team
- Clinical staff (RN, MD, PharmD)
- Trained moderators with clinical oversight
- AI pre-screening for obvious violations
- Human final decision on borderline cases

#### Moderation Response Time
- Target: Within 48 hours of submission
- Patient notified when review is published or rejected

**Rejection Notification**:
```
Thank you for your review. Unfortunately, we cannot 
publish it because [reason]. 

We encourage you to submit a revised review that 
[specific guidance].
```

### Step 4: Community Flagging System

**Patients can flag published reviews for**:
- 🚩 Offensive content
- 🚩 Medically inaccurate
- 🚩 Spam
- 🚩 Not relevant to this card

**When a Review is Flagged**:
1. Flagged review re-enters moderation queue
2. Human moderator reviews within 24 hours
3. If violation confirmed → Review removed
4. Original reviewer notified
5. Flagging user thanked (if flag was valid)

**Abuse Prevention**:
- Users who repeatedly flag valid reviews lose flagging privileges
- Users who repeatedly violate guidelines lose review privileges
- All actions logged for audit trail

**Use Cases for Clinicians**:
- **Set realistic expectations**: "Most patients see results in 2 weeks"
- **Pre-empt barriers**: "12% report dry cough - I'll mention that upfront"
- **Choose alternatives**: "This card has low adherence - let me pick an easier one"
- **Personalize**: "Patients your age found this very effective"

## QUALITY IMPROVEMENT FEEDBACK LOOP

### How Community Data Improves Cards

#### Cycle 1: Identify Issues
```
Example: Metformin 1000mg BID
- Reviews mention: "Terrible stomach upset"
- Adherence: Only 52%
- Target achievement: 68%

→ Problem identified: GI side effects driving poor adherence
```

#### Cycle 2: Update Card
```
Card Update v2.0:
- Add to HOW section: "Start at 500mg for 1 week, then increase"
- Add to SUCCESS TIPS: "Take with food, increase slowly"
- Add to SAFETY: "GI upset common but improves in 2 weeks"

→ Re-educate patients and clinicians
```

#### Cycle 3: Measure Improvement
```
After v2.0 release:
- New reviews mention: "Some stomach issues at first but went away"
- Adherence: Increased to 64%
- Target achievement: Increased to 75%

→ Improvement confirmed
```

#### Cycle 4: Iterate Further
```
Continue monitoring and refining based on ongoing feedback
