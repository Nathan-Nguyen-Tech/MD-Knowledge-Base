### Individual Pillar Scores

- **🟡 Moderate**: Any pillar < 6.0

---

## ACTION PLANNING FRAMEWORK

After completing each assessment, use low scores to create action plans:

### Step 1: Identify Priorities
- Look at which pillar(s) scored lowest
- Within that pillar, find the specific questions with lowest scores

### Step 2: Discuss with Patient
- "I noticed your score was low for [specific question]. Can you tell me more about that?"
- "What makes [healthy behavior] difficult for you?"
- "What do you think would help?"

### Step 3: Collaborative Goal-Setting
- Patient chooses 1-2 specific areas to work on
- Create SMART goals together (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound)
- Example: "I will eat vegetables at dinner 4 times this week" (not "I'll eat healthier")

### Step 4: Action Steps
- Break goal into small steps
- Identify resources or support needed
- Schedule follow-up

### Step 5: Track Progress
- Reassess those specific questions at next appropriate interval
- Celebrate improvements
- Adjust plan if needed

### Sample Action Plan Template

```
PATIENT: [Name]  DATE: [Date]

LOW-SCORING AREAS:

  - Lowest: Sleep duration (3/10), Stress management (4/10)
- Nutrition: 5.8/10 
  - Lowest: Vegetables (4/10), Meal planning (5/10)

PATIENT-SELECTED PRIORITY: Improve sleep

BARRIERS DISCUSSED:
- Works late, hard to maintain schedule
- Stressed from work, mind races at bedtime
- Uses phone in bed

COLLABORATIVE GOAL:
Get 7 hours of sleep at least 5 nights this week

ACTION STEPS:
1. Set phone alarm for bedtime (not just wake time)

## KEY IMPROVEMENTS IN VERSION 2.0

### From Version 1.0 to 2.0

1. **Reduced Redundancy**: 100 → 85 questions
   - Removed duplicate stress questions
   - Combined overlapping energy questions
   - Eliminated loneliness duplication

2. **Patient-Friendly Language**:
   - Simple words (6-8th grade reading level)
   - No medical jargon (removed "servings," "NEAT," technical terms)
   - Clear, conversational tone

3. **Embedded Education**:
   - Each question teaches evidence-based recommendations
   - Patients learn while they assess themselves
   - Format: "Experts recommend [X]. How well do you [X]?"

4. **Subjective Scoring**:
   - Removed specific numbers (10,000 steps, hours, frequencies)
   - All scoring based on patient's self-perception
   - Scale anchors describe experiences, not measurements

5. **Tiered Assessment**:
   - Questions assigned to appropriate frequencies
   - Prevents patient overwhelm
   - Spreads burden over time
   - Dynamic (every visit) for high-impact items
   - Stable factors assessed less often

6. **Action-Oriented**:
   - Designed to generate clinical discussions
   - Low scores = intervention opportunities  
   - Repeated assessment = education reinforcement
