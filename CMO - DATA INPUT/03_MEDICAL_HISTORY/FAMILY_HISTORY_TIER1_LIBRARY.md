# Family History Tier 1 Library v1.0

**Document Version:** 1.0
**Last Updated:** 2025-11-25
**Purpose:** Standardized family history conditions with hereditary significance for risk stratification and preventive screening recommendations

---

## Document Overview

This document defines **15 Tier 1 family history conditions** that significantly impact patient risk assessment and clinical decision-making. Each condition includes:

1. **Patient-Friendly Label** - How condition appears on intake form
2. **Genetic/Hereditary Significance** - Strength of familial association
3. **Risk Impact** - Score modifiers applied to patient's health dashboard
4. **Age Thresholds** - Early-onset vs. standard risk stratification
5. **Affected Relative Impact** - Risk varies by relationship (parent, sibling, child)
6. **Clinical Actions Triggered** - Screening recommendations, genetic counseling needs
7. **Smart Expansion Questions** - Brief follow-ups when condition checked

### Clinical Rationale

Family history is one of the strongest predictors of disease risk, often indicating:
- Shared genetic susceptibility
- Shared environmental/lifestyle factors
- Need for earlier or more intensive screening
- Candidacy for genetic testing

**Focus:** This library emphasizes **actionable** family history - conditions where knowing family history changes clinical management.

## Intake Priority System

**All 15 conditions are Priority 1** (always visible on intake form)
- High clinical impact
- Patient-identifiable conditions
- Each has 1-3 brief expansion questions

**Skip Option:** "No significant family history" checkbox allows patients to skip entire section
