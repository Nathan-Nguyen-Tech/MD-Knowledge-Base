## 🎭 ROLE-PLAYING SCENARIOS FOR BD TEAM

### Scenario 1: "The Skeptical Patient"

**Patient:** "Why do you need all this information? My doctor already has it."

**BD Response:**
"This form creates your personalized Health Overview Dashboard - think of it like a 'check engine light' for your health. The more complete your information, the more accurate your health scores will be. It only takes 5-10 minutes, and the form is smart - it only asks follow-up questions based on your answers, so you're not wasting time on irrelevant questions."

---

### Scenario 2: "The Technophobe"

**Patient:** "I'm not good with computers. Can I just fill out a paper form?"

**BD Response:**
"Absolutely! We have a paper version too. But the online form is really simple - it's all point-and-click with checkboxes, no typing required. And if you have medications, you can just snap a photo of your bottles instead of writing them all out. Most of our patients find it easier than paper. Would you like me to show you how it works on your phone?"

---

### Scenario 3: "The Busy Professional"

**Patient:** "I don't have time for a long form right now."

**BD Response:**
"Good news - most people finish in 5-10 minutes. And you can save your progress anytime and finish later. We'll email you a link to resume exactly where you left off. You could even start it now and finish during your lunch break tomorrow if needed."

---

### Scenario 4: "The Privacy-Concerned Patient"

**Patient:** "Is my information secure? I don't want my health data online."

**BD Response:**
"Absolutely secure. This form uses bank-level encryption, and your information is stored in our HIPAA-compliant system. Only your healthcare team has access to your data. We never share your information without your permission. It's actually more secure than paper forms, which can be lost or seen by anyone in the office."

---

### Scenario 5: "The Medication List Nightmare"

**Patient:** "I take 12 medications. I can't remember all the names and doses."

**BD Response:**
"Perfect - that's exactly why we added the photo feature! Just take a quick photo of all your medication bottles lined up, and our clinical team will read the labels and enter them for you. Takes 10 seconds instead of 10 minutes. Most of our patients love this feature."
