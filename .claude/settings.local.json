      "Bash(git commit -m \"$(cat <<''EOF''\nConsolidate integration architecture + add multi-agent AI system\n\nCONSOLIDATION (Option B):\n- Integrated UPDATE_CHECKLIST into INTEGRATION_ARCHITECTURE.md (Appendix A)\n- Integrated VERSION_CONTROL protocol into INTEGRATION_ARCHITECTURE.md (Appendix B)\n- Removed standalone redundant files\n- Result: 3 core master files instead of 6\n\nINTEGRATION_ARCHITECTURE v2.0:\n- Now includes cross-project update checklist as quick reference\n- Added version control workflow (6-step process)\n- Critical dependency chains documented\n- Reduced file proliferation while maintaining all content\n\nNEW: MULTI-AGENT AI SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE (Section 3):\n- 5 specialized AI agents working collaboratively:\n  1. Dr. ADAPT - Clinical decision agent (prescription/de-prescribing)\n  2. PharmaSafe - Medication safety agent (interactions/contraindications)\n  3. CoachAI - Behavioral & adherence agent (lifestyle cards)\n  4. DataWatch - Monitoring & alert agent (24/7 dashboard surveillance)\n  5. PatientPal - Patient interface & triage agent\n\nKEY IMPROVEMENTS:\n- 97% autonomous decisions (up from 80% in 3-tier model)\n- 4-tier progressive automation (Tier 1: 90% fully autonomous)\n- Patient-first decision architecture (patients initiate 95% of actions)\n- Minimal clinician burden (15-30 min per 100 patients)\n- All 12 card types covered (corrected from 9)\n\nDE-PRESCRIBING PATHWAYS (Detailed):\n1. GRADUATION - Success pathway (goal achieved, celebrated)\n2. TRANSITION - Adjustment pathway (too easy/hard/different method needed)\n3. DISCONTINUATION - Stop pathway (no longer needed/effective)\n\nTECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION:\n- Multi-agent orchestration using LangChain/CrewAI\n- LLM foundation (GPT-4/Claude) + specialized knowledge bases\n- 5-layer safety net (hard rules, confidence thresholds, multi-agent validation)\n- Phased roadmap (Months 1-18 to full deployment)\n\nFILE GOVERNANCE:\n- Consolidation-first philosophy prevents file bloat\n- Every file must pass 3-question test (uniqueness, longevity, necessity)\n- Result: Cleaner, more maintainable project structure\n\n🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)\n\nCo-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>\nEOF\n)\")",
