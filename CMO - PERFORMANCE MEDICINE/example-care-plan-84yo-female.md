## Your Health Goal

**What matters most to you**:
"I want to stay in my home, maintain my independence as much as possible, and have energy to enjoy my family."

**How we'll measure success**:
- ✅ **Stop losing weight** - Gain 2-3 pounds over next 3 months
- ✅ **Improve energy** - Able to complete self-care activities without exhaustion
- ✅ **Prevent infections** - Reduce how often you get sick
- ✅ **Stay out of hospital** - Avoid hospitalizations over next 6 months

---

## What We're Focusing On

You have **3 high-priority areas** that need immediate attention:

### 1. 🔴 Weight Loss & Poor Appetite (HIGHEST PRIORITY)
**The Problem**: You're losing weight and not eating enough. This causes muscle loss → weakness → fall risk → loss of independence.

**Our Plan**: High-protein nutrition, protein shakes, strategies to improve appetite

### 2. 🔴 Frequent Infections (HIGH PRIORITY)
**The Problem**: Your adrenal insufficiency (low cortisol) weakens your immune system, plus you're frail, so you get sick easily.

**Our Plan**: Optimize your hydrocortisone dose, ensure you're increasing it when sick (CRITICAL!), get all vaccinations, nutritional support

### 3. 🔴 Weakness & Fall Risk (HIGH PRIORITY)
**The Problem**: Muscle weakness from weight loss increases your fall risk. Falls → fractures → hospitalization → loss of independence.

**Our Plan**: Preserve muscle with protein and movement, home safety modifications, assistive devices if needed

---

## Your Medications

### ⚠️ CRITICAL - Hydrocortisone "Sick Day Rules"

**YOU MUST INCREASE HYDROCORTISONE WHEN SICK**

When you have:
- Fever over 100.4°F
- Infection (cold, flu, UTI, pneumonia)
- Vomiting or diarrhea
- Injury or surgery

**What to do**:
1. **DOUBLE or TRIPLE your usual hydrocortisone dose** during illness
2. Call us to report illness and confirm dosing
3. **If vomiting and can't keep pills down → GO TO EMERGENCY ROOM** (you need IV hydrocortisone - this is life-threatening)

**Wear medical alert bracelet**: "Adrenal Insufficiency - Requires Hydrocortisone"

---

### Medication Changes We're Making

#### 1. Hydrocortisone
- **What it's for**: Your adrenal glands don't make enough cortisol - this medication replaces it
- **Critical for**: Immune function, energy, handling stress/illness
- **Changes**: [Review dose, ensure stress dosing protocol understood]
- ⚠️ **Never skip this medication** - life-threatening if stopped suddenly

#### 2. Levothyroxine (Thyroid Medicine)
- **What it's for**: Your thyroid doesn't make enough thyroid hormone
- **Critical for**: Energy, metabolism, preventing weight loss
- **Changes**: Check TSH in 2 weeks to ensure dose is right
- **Take**: 30-60 minutes before breakfast, on empty stomach

#### 3. Blood Pressure Medicine
- **Goal**: Blood pressure <150/90 (NOT too low - low BP causes dizziness and falls)
- **Changes**: We'll check your BP sitting and standing (orthostatic check) - if too low, we'll reduce dose
- **Home monitoring**: Check BP 2-3 times per week, keep a log

#### 4. GERD Medicine (Heartburn)
- **What it's for**: Control heartburn so you can eat comfortably
- **Take**: 30-60 minutes before breakfast
- **Keep taking**: Benefits outweigh risks at your age - this helps you eat

#### 5. Medications We're STOPPING (Deprescribing)
- ❌ **Statin** (if you're on one) - No benefit at age 84, can cause muscle aches
- ❌ **Aspirin** (if on it for prevention, not after heart attack) - Bleeding risk too high
- ❌ **Unnecessary supplements** - Keep only Vitamin D and Calcium

---

## Lab Work & Testing (Next 2-4 Weeks)

We need to check:
- ☐ **Thyroid** (TSH, Free T4) - Make sure thyroid dose is right
- ☐ **Cortisol** (8am blood test) - Make sure hydrocortisone dose is adequate
- ☐ **Blood count** (CBC) - Check for anemia (can cause fatigue)
- ☐ **Kidney function** (creatinine) - Monitor your CKD
- ☐ **Albumin** - Marker of nutritional status
- ☐ **Vitamin D** - Likely low (causes muscle weakness)
- ☐ **Vitamin B12** - Often low in elderly (causes fatigue)

---

## Vaccinations (Get These Soon)

- ☐ **Flu vaccine** (annual) - if not received this season
- ☐ **Pneumonia vaccine** (PPSV23) - if not current
- ☐ **COVID-19 booster** - if eligible
- ☐ **Shingles vaccine** (Shingrix) - 2-dose series if not previously received

---

## Your Supplements (Critical for Frailty Reversal)

### 1. Vitamin D3 - 2000 IU daily
**Why**: Bone health, muscle strength, immune function
**When**: Take with meal (better absorption)

### 2. Calcium - 1200mg daily (split into 2 doses)
**Why**: Bone health, fracture prevention
**How**: 600mg with breakfast, 600mg with dinner
**Type**: Calcium carbonate (Tums) OR calcium citrate

### 3. Protein Supplement - 1-2 servings daily
**Why**: **THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT SUPPLEMENT** - You're not eating enough protein from food
**Options**:
- Whey protein powder (mix in milk or smoothie)
- Ensure High Protein (ready-to-drink)
- Boost High Protein (ready-to-drink)
- Premier Protein shakes

**Dose**: 20-30g protein per serving

### 4. Probiotic - Daily
**Why**: Immune support, gut health (important with frequent infections)
**Options**: Culturelle, Florastor, or any generic Lactobacillus

---

## 🍽️ Nutrition Plan (MOST IMPORTANT - REVERSE FRAILTY)

### Goal: STOP Losing Weight - GAIN 2-3 Pounds Over 3 Months

### Protein Target: 60-75 grams per day

**Why protein matters**: Protein is THE most important nutrient for preventing muscle loss. Without it, you cannot maintain muscle → you get weaker → higher fall risk.

---

### How to Get 60-75g Protein Per Day

#### Breakfast (20-25g protein) - Pick One:
- 🥚 **2 eggs + 1 slice cheese + 1 cup Greek yogurt** = 34g
- 🥣 **Oatmeal made with milk + 1 scoop protein powder + peanut butter** = 29g
- 🥤 **Ensure/Boost High Protein shake + toast with peanut butter** = 24g

#### Lunch (20-25g protein) - Pick One:
- 🍗 **Chicken or tuna salad sandwich** = 25g
- 🍲 **Soup with beans + cheese + crackers** = 20g
- 🧀 **1 cup cottage cheese + fruit** = 28g

#### Dinner (20-25g protein) - Pick One:
- 🍖 **3-4 oz chicken, fish, or beef** = 20-28g
- 🫘 **1 cup beans/lentils + cheese** = 22g
- 🍜 **Tofu stir-fry + rice** = 15g

#### Snacks (10-15g protein) - Pick One or Two:
- Greek yogurt = 15g
- Cheese stick = 7g
- Protein shake = 20g
- Peanut butter on crackers = 4-8g

---

### Strategies for Poor Appetite

#### 1. Eat Small, Frequent Meals
- **5-6 small meals/snacks per day** instead of 3 large meals
- Easier to get calories without feeling too full

#### 2. Use Calorie-Dense Foods
**Add butter, oil, cheese, nuts to everything** (adds calories without adding volume):
- Butter on toast, vegetables, rice
- Olive oil on salads, pasta
- Cheese on everything
- Whole milk (NOT skim) - full-fat yogurt

**Smoothies** - Liquid calories are easier than solid food:
- Whole milk + protein powder + banana + peanut butter + avocado = 500+ calories

#### 3. Make Eating Comfortable
- If heartburn makes eating uncomfortable → you won't eat → weight loss
- Take GERD medicine 30-60 min before breakfast (not with food)
- Avoid spicy, acidic foods if they worsen heartburn

#### 4. Consider Social Eating
- **Meals on Wheels** - Delivers hot meal + daily social check-in
- **Senior center meals** - Social eating improves appetite
- **Family brings meals** - Easier than cooking

#### 5. If Nothing Helps
- We can prescribe **appetite stimulant medication** (Megace or Marinol)
- Only if non-medication strategies fail

---

### Foods to Emphasize

**High-Protein**:
- Eggs, chicken, fish, beef, Greek yogurt, cottage cheese, cheese, beans, protein shakes

**Anti-Inflammatory (Immune Support)**:
- Colorful vegetables, berries, salmon, olive oil, nuts

**Easy-to-Eat, Calorie-Dense**:
- Smoothies, soups, yogurt, **ice cream** (yes! If it gets you calories), avocado, nut butters

---

### Hydration

**Target**: 6-8 cups (48-64 oz) per day

**Why**: Dehydration causes confusion, weakness, worsens kidney function

**How**: Sip water throughout day, drink with meals, include soups, herbal tea

⚠️ **Stop fluids 2-3 hours before bed** (reduces nighttime bathroom trips → reduces fall risk)

---

## 🚶 Movement Plan (Preserve Muscle, Prevent Falls)

**Goal**: Maintain mobility and prevent falls - NOT to train hard

**Movement should feel manageable, not exhausting**

---

### Daily Walking - 10-15 Minutes Per Day

**Why**: Maintains leg strength, balance, circulation, mood

**How**:
- Walk indoors (safer than outdoors if balance concern)
- Use assistive device if needed (cane, walker)
- Can split into 2-3 short walks

**Listen to your body**: If tired after 5 minutes, stop. Gradually increase as energy improves.

---

### Sit-to-Stand Exercise - 3 Times Per Day

**Why**: **THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT EXERCISE** - You need leg strength to get out of chair, off toilet, out of bed

**How**:
1. Sit in sturdy chair (with armrests if needed)
2. Stand up, then sit back down
3. Repeat 5 times
4. Do this 3 times per day (morning, afternoon, evening) = **15 reps/day**

**As you get stronger**: Try to use arms less, rely on legs more

---

### Balance Exercises - Daily (Prevent Falls)

**⚠️ SAFETY: Always do near counter, wall, or sturdy furniture**

Pick 1-2 that feel safe:

**Tandem Stance**:
- Stand with one foot in front of the other (like walking a tightrope)
- Hold for 10 seconds
- Do near counter for safety

**Heel Raises**:
- Stand at counter
- Raise up on toes, hold 3 seconds, lower
- Repeat 10 times

**Single-Leg Stand** (if feel comfortable):
- Stand on one leg near counter/wall
- Hold for 10 seconds
- Repeat other leg

---

### ❌ What to AVOID

- ❌ No running, jumping, high-impact activities (fall risk)
- ❌ No heavy lifting (>10 lbs)
- ❌ No exercise if dizzy, weak, or unwell

---

## 😴 Sleep & Rest

**Goal**: 7-8 hours per night, with daytime rest as needed

### Sleep Window
- **Bedtime**: 9:30-10:00 PM
- **Wake time**: 6:00-7:00 AM
- **Naps**: OK to nap 30-60 minutes in afternoon if tired (rest when needed!)

### Sleep Tips
- **Bedroom**: Dark, quiet, comfortable (68-72°F)
- **Stop fluids by 6-7 PM** (reduces nighttime bathroom trips)
- **Night light**: Keep path to bathroom well-lit (fall prevention)
- **Consider bedside commode** if getting to bathroom at night is difficult/unsafe

---

## 🏠 Home Safety (Prevent Falls)

### Bathroom (Highest Fall Risk Area)
- ☐ **Grab bars** next to toilet and in shower
- ☐ **Non-slip mat** in shower/tub
- ☐ **Raised toilet seat** (makes standing easier)
- ☐ **Shower chair** (sit while bathing)

### Bedroom

- ☐ **Reacher/grabber** (pick up items without bending)
- ☐ **Shower chair** (sit while bathing)
- ☐ **Raised toilet seat** (easier to stand)
- ☐ **Medical alert system** (Life Alert - fall detection, call for help)

**We can refer you to Physical/Occupational Therapy** to assess what you need

---

## 💊 Medication Management

- ☐ **Weekly pill organizer** (fill once per week, reduces confusion)
- ☐ **Medication list** (keep updated, carry in wallet, post on fridge)
- ☐ **Reminder system** (phone alarm or pill dispenser with alarm)

---

## 🤝 Social Connection & Mental Health

**Goal**: Reduce isolation, maintain cognitive function, manage anxiety

### Social Connection (Important for Appetite, Mood, Cognition)
- **Family visits**: 2-3 times per week (phone calls daily if in-person not possible)
