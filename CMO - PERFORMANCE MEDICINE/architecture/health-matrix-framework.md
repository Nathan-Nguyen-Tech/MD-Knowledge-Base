# The Health Matrix Framework

## Overview

The Health Matrix is the core clinical organizing structure of Performance Medicine. It provides a systematic way to assess, prioritize, and track health across all body systems and clinical domains, enabling clinicians and patients to see the complete picture on one shared dashboard.

**Important**: The Health Matrix is populated through **comprehensive, multipart health assessment** that includes:
- Complete medical history (including family history, surgeries, medications, lifestyle)
- Physical examination (vital signs, biometrics, system-by-system exam)
- Laboratory testing (metabolic panels, lipids, hormones, inflammatory markers)
- Imaging studies (ultrasound, X-ray, MRI, CT, echocardiography)
- Functional testing (exercise capacity, strength, balance, cognitive tests)
- Patient-reported outcomes (symptoms, quality of life, functional impact)

All of these assessment tools work together to determine how each of the 8 health systems is functioning across the 3 clinical domains.

*For detailed assessment methodology, see [comprehensive-health-assessment.md](comprehensive-health-assessment.md)*

## The Matrix Structure

The Health Matrix is organized as **8 Health Systems × 3 Clinical Domains**, creating 24 assessment cells that together paint a comprehensive picture of health status.

### The Eight Health Systems

Performance Medicine organizes the body into eight interconnected systems rather than isolated diagnoses:

1. **Neurological (Brain and Nervous System)**
   - Sleep, attention, mood, cognition
   - Pain processing and sensory function
   - Autonomic regulation (stress response, heart rate variability)
   - Motor control and coordination

2. **Cardiovascular System**
   - Blood pressure patterns
   - Heart rate and rhythm
   - Exercise tolerance and cardiac output
   - Vascular health and circulation

3. **Respiratory System**
   - Breathing capacity and efficiency
   - Oxygen saturation
   - Respiratory rate and pattern
   - Airway health

4. **Metabolic and Digestive System**
   - Glucose regulation (fasting glucose, A1c, insulin sensitivity)
   - Lipid metabolism
   - Digestive function and gut health
   - Energy production and body composition
   - Thyroid function (T3, T4, TSH - metabolism regulation)

5. **Filtration and Urinary System (Kidneys)**
   - Kidney function (eGFR, creatinine)
   - Fluid and electrolyte balance
   - Toxin clearance
   - Blood pressure regulation

6. **Musculoskeletal System**
   - Strength and power
   - Joint mobility and stability
   - Bone density
   - Pain and functional movement capacity

7. **Immune System**
   - Infection resistance
   - Inflammatory markers (hsCRP, ESR)
   - Autoimmune activity
   - Recovery from illness
   - Stress response hormones (cortisol, catecholamines - adrenaline, noradrenaline)

8. **Reproductive and Hormonal System**
   - Sex hormones (testosterone, estrogen, progesterone, DHEA)
   - Reproductive health and fertility
   - Sexual function and libido
   - Menstrual cycle regulation (for women)
   - Prostate health (for men)
   - Reproductive cancer screening (breast, cervical, prostate, testicular)

### The Three Clinical Domains

Each of the eight systems is assessed across three complementary domains:

#### 1. Structure (Cấu Trúc)
**What the anatomy and "hardware" show**

- Imaging findings (X-ray, MRI, CT, ultrasound)
- Anatomical measurements (chamber size, wall thickness, bone density)
- Physical examination findings
- Structural integrity and architecture

**Examples:**
- Cardiovascular: Left ventricular hypertrophy on echo, carotid plaque on ultrasound
- Musculoskeletal: Meniscal tear on MRI, bone mineral density T-score
- Neurological: Brain MRI findings, nerve conduction studies

#### 2. Function (Chức Năng)
**How the system performs in daily life**

- Performance capacity (what you can do today)
- Symptom interference (pain, fatigue, breathlessness)
- Functional testing (walk distance, sit-to-stand, grip strength)
- Patient-reported outcomes (energy, sleep quality, activity tolerance)

**Examples:**
- Cardiovascular: 6-minute walk distance, stairs without breathlessness, recovery heart rate
- Musculoskeletal: Sit-to-stand repetitions, pain interference score, carry capacity
- Neurological: Sleep quality rating, attention span, mood stability

#### 3. Risk (Nguy Cơ)
**What forward-looking markers say about future health trajectory**

- Laboratory biomarkers (A1c, lipids, inflammatory markers)
- Calculated risk scores (ASCVD risk, fracture risk)
- Trend direction (improving, stable, worsening)
- Preventive screening results

**Examples:**
- Cardiovascular: ASCVD 10-year risk, ApoB, Lp(a), CAC score
- Metabolic: A1c trend, fasting insulin, visceral fat
- Musculoskeletal: FRAX score, vitamin D level

## The Dashboard View

The Health Matrix translates into a visual dashboard with **traffic-light status indicators**:

- **Green**: Optimal or on target
- **Yellow**: Watch zone - needs monitoring or minor adjustment
- **Orange**: Action needed - moderate priority
- **Red**: High priority - requires immediate intervention

### Matrix Layout

```
                    STRUCTURE    FUNCTION    RISK        ACTION
Neurological           ⚫           ⚫          ⚫          [Plan]
Cardiovascular         ⚫           ⚫          ⚫          [Plan]
Respiratory            ⚫           ⚫          ⚫          [Plan]
Metabolic              ⚫           ⚫          ⚫          [Plan]
Filtration             ⚫           ⚫          ⚫          [Plan]
Musculoskeletal        ⚫           ⚫          ⚫          [Plan]
Immune                 ⚫           ⚫          ⚫          [Plan]
Reproductive/Hormonal  ⚫           ⚫          ⚫          [Plan]
```

Each circle represents a status indicator, and the Action column links directly to the unified prescription for that system.

## How the Matrix Guides Clinical Reasoning

### 1. Comprehensive Assessment
The matrix prevents blind spots by forcing systematic review of all eight systems across all three domains. A person with knee pain isn't just "musculoskeletal function orange"—we also check:
- Metabolic function and risk (does A1c affect healing?)
- Cardiovascular capacity (does conditioning limit rehab progression?)
- Neurological function (is sleep debt amplifying pain?)

### 2. Priority Setting (Triage by Color)
**Reds** - Address first (safety and capacity limiters)
- Out-of-range BP requiring immediate adjustment
- Acute pain preventing daily function
- Sleep so fragmented that nothing else can progress

**Oranges** - Address second (capacity and resilience drains)
- Borderline A1c trending up
- Pain interference limiting activity
- Poor recovery after exertion

**Yellows** - Monitor and tune
- Lipids slightly elevated but stable
- Mild stiffness not limiting function
- Sleep timing inconsistent on weekends

**Greens** - Protect and maintain
- Well-controlled BP with good adherence
- Strong, pain-free movement
- Consistent, restorative sleep

### 3. Personalized Targets
Each cell in the matrix has an **individualized target** based on:
- The person's goals and season of life
- Evidence-based clinical guidelines
- Current capacity and constraints
- Comorbidities and risk profile

Progress is measured as **distance from target**, normalized and weighted by clinical importance.

### 4. Systems Integration
The matrix makes **cross-system effects** visible:

**Example 1: Poor sleep (Neurological Function - Red) affects:**
- Cardiovascular: Higher BP variability, reduced HRV
- Metabolic: Worse insulin sensitivity, increased appetite dysregulation
- Musculoskeletal: Slower tissue repair, lower pain threshold
- Immune: Higher infection susceptibility

**Example 2: Chronic pain (Musculoskeletal Function - Red) affects:**
- Neurological: Sleep fragmentation, mood dysregulation
- Cardiovascular: Reduced activity tolerance
- Metabolic: Stress-driven glucose elevation

## Linking the Matrix to the Five Lifestyle Pillars

The Five Lifestyle Pillars are the **intervention levers** that change the systems:

1. **Movement** → Primarily affects Cardiovascular, Respiratory, Musculoskeletal, Metabolic
2. **Nutrition** → Primarily affects Metabolic, Cardiovascular, Immune, Musculoskeletal
3. **Sleep and Recovery** → Primarily affects Neurological, Immune, Metabolic, Cardiovascular
4. **Mental and Emotional Health** → Primarily affects Neurological, Cardiovascular, Immune, Metabolic
5. **Surroundings and Social Context** → Affects all systems by enabling or blocking the other four pillars

## The Unified Prescription Format

For each priority item identified in the matrix, the Action column contains:

**Format:**
```
[System] - [Domain] - [Priority Level]
Target: [Specific, measurable goal]
Current Status: [Baseline measurement]

Medical Actions:
- [Medication/test/procedure] | Purpose | Dose/Schedule | Safety Notes | Review Date

Lifestyle Actions:
- [Movement/Nutrition/Sleep/Mental Health/Environment] | Purpose | Dose/Schedule | Safety Notes | Review Date

Monitoring Plan:
- What we'll track: [Specific measures]
- How: [Home monitoring, labs, functional tests]
- When: [Next check-in date]
```

**Example:**
```
Cardiovascular - Function + Risk - ORANGE

Target: Home BP average <130/80, walk 20 minutes without breathlessness
Current: Home BP averaging 142/88, walks 10 minutes before stopping

Medical Actions:
- Amlodipine 5mg daily | Lower BP | Take each morning | Watch for ankle swelling | Review 3 weeks
- Home BP monitoring | Track response | Twice daily (morning/evening) | Log in app | Bring to next visit

Lifestyle Actions:
- Walking | Build cardiovascular capacity | 10-15 min after dinner, 5 days/week | Stop if chest pain/dizziness | Review 3 weeks
- Sodium strategy | Lower BP | <2300mg daily, focus on processed foods | N/A | Review 3 weeks
- Sleep anchor | Support BP dip at night | Lights out by 10:30pm | N/A | Review 3 weeks

Monitoring Plan:
- What: Home BP (morning/evening), walk duration before breathlessness, sleep quality
- How: BP cuff at home, walk timer, sleep diary
- When: Check-in 3 weeks (sooner if BP >160/100 or chest symptoms)
```

## Clinical Use Cases

### Use Case 1: Hypertension in an Athlete
**Matrix View:**
- Cardiovascular Structure: YELLOW (mild LVH on echo)
- Cardiovascular Function: YELLOW (good exercise tolerance, but recovery HR slow)
- Cardiovascular Risk: ORANGE (home BP 145/90, no medication yet)
- Neurological Function: ORANGE (sleep 6 hours, fragmented)
- Metabolic Risk: GREEN (excellent lipids, normal glucose)

**Clinical Reasoning:**
Sleep debt is likely driving BP elevation. Address neurological function (sleep) AND cardiovascular risk (BP) together.

**Unified Prescription:**
- Sleep window 10:30pm-6:30am + morning light exposure
- Home BP monitoring
- Consider low-dose ARB if BP not improved in 4 weeks
- Continue strength training (supports metabolic health - maintain the green)

### Use Case 2: Back Pain with Prediabetes
**Matrix View:**
- Musculoskeletal Function: RED (pain interference 7/10, limited walking)
- Musculoskeletal Structure: YELLOW (mild disc bulge, no nerve compression)
- Metabolic Risk: ORANGE (A1c 6.2%, fasting glucose 118)
- Cardiovascular Function: YELLOW (deconditioned, but no cardiac symptoms)
- Neurological Function: ORANGE (sleep disrupted by pain)

**Clinical Reasoning:**
Pain is limiting activity, which worsens metabolic risk. Treat musculoskeletal function AND metabolic risk simultaneously.

**Unified Prescription:**
- Graded walking + core strengthening (targets both MSK and metabolic)
- Workstation ergonomics (reduce pain flares)
- Protein-forward meals + step target (metabolic control)
- Topical NSAIDs + sleep positioning (immediate pain relief to enable movement)
- Track: Pain interference, sit-to-stand reps, fasting glucose, waist circumference

## Matrix-Driven Follow-Up

At each follow-up visit:

1. **Update the Matrix** with current measurements
2. **Compare to targets** - calculate distance and trend direction
3. **Re-triage by color** - what moved from red→orange→yellow→green?
4. **Identify new priorities** - what emerged or worsened?
5. **Adjust the unified prescription** - progress what's working, change what isn't
6. **Set next review date** based on highest priority items

## Integration with the Wellness Wheel

The Health Matrix sits at the **Systems ring** of the Compass Wellness Wheel:

- **Center**: Purpose (What health needs to allow right now)
- **Inner ring**: Awareness (Mindful attention to body signals and life context)
- **Middle ring**: **Eight Health Systems** (The Matrix lives here)
- **Outer rings**: Five Lifestyle Pillars + Surroundings/Social Context
- **Outermost ring**: Clinical Stance (Treatment/Prevention/Maintenance/Enhancement)

The Matrix translates purpose and awareness into **system-specific priorities**, which are then addressed through the **lifestyle pillars**, all within the appropriate **clinical stance**.

## Summary

The Health Matrix Framework is the **operating system** of Performance Medicine:

- **Prevents blind spots** by systematically reviewing all systems and domains
- **Enables prioritization** through traffic-light triage
- **Personalizes care** with individualized targets
- **Reveals connections** between systems
- **Guides intervention** through the five lifestyle pillars
- **Tracks progress** with consistent, meaningful measures
- **Unifies the prescription** so medical and lifestyle actions reinforce each other

It transforms complexity into clarity, turning seven systems and three domains into **one dashboard, one plan, and one path forward**.
