# Comprehensive Health Assessment in Performance Medicine

## Overview

Health assessment in Performance Medicine is **multipart and comprehensive**. It uses multiple evaluation tools and methods to determine the status of the 8 health systems across 3 clinical domains (Structure, Function, Risk).

The assessment is not just one examination—it's the integration of:
- Medical history
- Physical examination
- Vital signs and biometrics
- Laboratory testing
- Imaging studies
- Functional testing
- Patient-reported outcomes

All of these assessment tools work together to paint a complete picture of health status within the Health Matrix framework.

## The Complete Assessment Workflow

### Step 1: Comprehensive Data Collection
Gather data from ALL sources:
- ✅ Full medical history (including family history, surgeries, medications)
- ✅ Vital signs and biometrics
- ✅ Physical examination of all systems
- ✅ Laboratory testing (comprehensive metabolic panel, lipids, A1c, CBC, etc.)
- ✅ Imaging studies (as indicated by history and exam)
- ✅ Functional testing (strength, endurance, balance, cognitive)
- ✅ Patient-reported outcomes (symptoms, function, quality of life)

### Step 2: Map Findings to the Health Matrix
Organize all findings into 8 Systems × 3 Domains (24 cells)

### Step 3: Assign Traffic Light Status
For each system and domain:
- 🟢 **Green**: Optimal or on target
- 🟡 **Yellow**: Watch zone - monitor
- 🟠 **Orange**: Action needed - moderate priority
- 🔴 **Red**: High priority - immediate intervention

### Step 4: Assess Capacity, Resilience, Flexibility
- **Capacity**: What can they do today? (Functional tests + PROs)
- **Resilience**: How quickly do they recover? (Recovery patterns + HRV)
- **Flexibility**: How well do they adapt? (Metabolic, circadian, stress flexibility)

### Step 5: Generate Problem List and Prioritize
- Reds first (safety, capacity limiters)
- Oranges second (capacity/resilience drains)
- Yellows for monitoring
- Greens to protect and maintain

### Step 6: Create Unified Prescription
- Medical interventions (medications, procedures, referrals)
- Lifestyle interventions (Movement, Nutrition, Sleep, Mental Health, Environment)
- Monitoring plan (what, how, when)

### Step 7: Follow-Up and Reassessment
- Repeat relevant assessments (labs, vitals, functional tests, PROs)
- Update Health Matrix with new data
- Adjust prescription based on response
- Track trends over time

## Summary

**Comprehensive health assessment is multipart and systematic:**

1. **Medical History** - Full story including family, surgeries, medications, lifestyle
2. **Physical Examination** - Vital signs, biometrics, system-by-system exam
3. **Laboratory Testing** - Metabolic panels, lipids, hormones, inflammatory markers
4. **Imaging Studies** - Structural assessment via ultrasound, X-ray, MRI, CT, echo
5. **Functional Testing** - Performance capacity (walk tests, strength, balance)
6. **Patient-Reported Outcomes** - Symptoms, function, quality of life

**All of these tools work together to determine how the 8 health systems are functioning** across Structure, Function, and Risk domains.

The Health Matrix organizes this complexity into a clear, actionable dashboard that guides prioritization and intervention through the unified prescription model.
