# The 8 Health Systems Assessment Method - For Business Development Team

## Overview for Business Development

The **8 Health Systems Assessment** is the core clinical methodology of Performance Medicine. It's not just "one type of exam"—it's a **comprehensive, multipart evaluation framework** that organizes ALL assessment data into a clear, actionable dashboard.

**Key Business Value**: This systematic approach ensures nothing is missed, reveals interconnections between health problems, and creates a unified treatment plan that addresses root causes rather than isolated symptoms.

---

## What IS the 8 Health Systems Assessment?

It's an **organizational framework** that integrates findings from multiple assessment tools:

### Assessment Components (The Tools)
1. **Complete Medical History** - Including family history, past surgeries, medications, lifestyle
2. **Physical Examination** - Vital signs, biometrics, system-by-system exam
3. **Laboratory Testing** - Blood work (metabolic panels, lipids, hormones, inflammatory markers)
4. **Imaging Studies** - Ultrasound, X-ray, MRI, CT scans, echocardiography
5. **Functional Testing** - Walk tests, strength assessments, balance, cognitive tests
6. **Patient-Reported Outcomes** - Symptoms, energy levels, sleep quality, pain interference

### The Framework (How We Organize It)
All assessment data is mapped into the **Health Matrix**: **8 Health Systems × 3 Clinical Domains**

---

## The 8 Health Systems

### 1. **Neurological System (Hệ Thần Kinh - Não Bộ)**
**What it controls**: Sleep, mood, cognition, pain processing, stress response, motor control

**How we assess it**:
- **History**: Sleep quality/duration, mood stability, stress levels, headaches, cognitive changes
- **Physical exam**: Mental status, reflexes, strength, sensation, balance, gait
- **Labs**: None specific (but vitamin D, B12, thyroid affect brain function)
- **Imaging**: Brain MRI (if indicated), nerve conduction studies
- **Functional tests**: Cognitive screening (MoCA), balance tests, HRV (heart rate variability - autonomic function)
- **Patient reports**: Sleep quality (0-10), energy levels, mood stability

**Business value**: Poor sleep and chronic stress affect ALL other systems and undermine treatment adherence. Addressing neurological function first often unlocks progress elsewhere.

---

### 2. **Cardiovascular System (Hệ Tuần Hoàn - Tim Mạch)**
**What it controls**: Blood pressure, heart function, circulation, oxygen delivery

**How we assess it**:
- **History**: Chest pain, shortness of breath, exercise tolerance, family history of heart disease
- **Physical exam**: Blood pressure (multiple readings), heart sounds, peripheral pulses, edema
- **Labs**: Lipid panel (LDL, HDL, triglycerides), ApoB, Lp(a), hsCRP (inflammation)
- **Imaging**: ECG, echocardiogram, carotid ultrasound, coronary artery calcium (CAC) score
- **Functional tests**: 6-minute walk test, stair tolerance, heart rate recovery after exercise
- **Patient reports**: Exercise capacity, breathlessness during activity

**Business value**: Cardiovascular disease is the #1 cause of death. Early detection and intervention prevent heart attacks, strokes, and sudden cardiac events. Improved cardiovascular function = improved capacity for all activities.

---

### 3. **Respiratory System (Hệ Hô Hấp - Phổi)**
**What it controls**: Breathing, oxygen delivery, carbon dioxide removal

**How we assess it**:
- **History**: Shortness of breath, cough, wheezing, smoking history, asthma/COPD
- **Physical exam**: Respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, lung sounds, chest expansion
- **Labs**: Oxygen saturation (SpO2) at rest and with exertion
- **Imaging**: Chest X-ray, CT chest (if indicated)
- **Functional tests**: Spirometry (lung volume/airflow), peak flow, exercise desaturation test
- **Patient reports**: Breathing comfort during activity

**Business value**: Respiratory limitations directly impact exercise capacity, recovery, and quality of life. Often overlooked until severe.

---

### 4. **Metabolic and Digestive System (Hệ Chuyển Hóa - Gan, Tiêu Hóa)**
**What it controls**: Energy production, glucose/insulin regulation, digestion, liver function, body composition

**How we assess it**:
- **History**: Energy crashes, weight changes, digestive symptoms (bloating, reflux, bowel habits), hunger patterns
- **Physical exam**: Weight, BMI, waist circumference, abdominal exam (liver size, tenderness)
- **Labs**:
  - **Glucose metabolism**: Fasting glucose, A1c, fasting insulin
  - **Liver function**: AST, ALT, GGT, bilirubin
  - **Lipids**: Triglycerides (metabolic marker)
  - **Inflammatory**: hsCRP
- **Imaging**: Abdominal ultrasound (fatty liver), DEXA scan (body composition - lean mass, fat mass, visceral fat)
- **Functional tests**: Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM - 24/7 glucose trends)
- **Patient reports**: Energy stability throughout day, post-meal symptoms

**Business value**: Prediabetes and metabolic syndrome affect 40%+ of adults. Early intervention can REVERSE prediabetes and prevent type 2 diabetes. Improved metabolic health = stable energy, better body composition, reduced cardiovascular risk.

---

### 5. **Filtration and Urinary System (Hệ Lọc Máu - Thận)**
**What it controls**: Kidney function, fluid/electrolyte balance, blood pressure regulation, toxin clearance

**How we assess it**:
- **History**: Urination frequency/volume, swelling in legs/ankles, kidney stones, infections
- **Physical exam**: Blood pressure (kidneys regulate BP), edema (swelling), flank tenderness
- **Labs**:
  - **Kidney function**: Creatinine, eGFR (estimated glomerular filtration rate), BUN
  - **Electrolytes**: Sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate
  - **Urine**: Urinalysis, urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (early kidney damage marker)
- **Imaging**: Kidney ultrasound (if indicated)
- **Functional tests**: None routine (kidney function assessed via labs)
- **Patient reports**: Fluid balance, urination changes

**Business value**: Chronic kidney disease is often silent until advanced. Early detection prevents progression to dialysis. Kidney health is tightly linked to blood pressure and cardiovascular health.

---

### 6. **Musculoskeletal System (Hệ Cơ Xương Khớp)**
**What it controls**: Strength, mobility, balance, bone density, pain-free movement

**How we assess it**:
- **History**: Joint pain, stiffness, muscle weakness, falls, functional limitations (stairs, carrying)
- **Physical exam**: Joint range of motion, strength testing (manual muscle testing 0-5 scale), balance, gait analysis
- **Labs**:
  - **Bone health**: Vitamin D, calcium
  - **Inflammation**: hsCRP, ESR (if arthritis suspected)
- **Imaging**:
  - **Bones**: X-rays (fractures, arthritis), DEXA scan (bone density - osteoporosis screening)
  - **Soft tissue**: MRI (ligament/tendon tears, disc herniations)
- **Functional tests**:
  - Sit-to-stand test (30 sec or 60 sec - lower body strength)
  - Grip strength (dynamometer - upper body strength)
  - Single-leg balance (fall risk)
  - Timed up-and-go (mobility)
  - Gait speed
- **Patient reports**: Pain interference (0-10), functional limitations

**Business value**: Musculoskeletal problems are the #1 cause of chronic pain and disability. Early intervention prevents progression, maintains independence, and preserves quality of life. Strong muscles = metabolic health (muscle is metabolically active tissue).

---

### 7. **Immune System (Hệ Miễn Dịch)**
**What it controls**: Infection resistance, inflammation regulation, autoimmune activity, stress response hormones (cortisol, catecholamines)

**How we assess it**:
- **History**: Frequency/duration of infections (colds, flu), autoimmune conditions, allergies, chronic inflammation, stress response patterns
- **Physical exam**: Lymph node palpation (cervical, axillary, inguinal), skin assessment (rashes, lesions)
- **Labs**:
  - **Blood counts**: CBC (white blood cells - infection/immune function)
  - **Inflammation**: hsCRP, ESR
  - **Autoimmune**: ANA, RF, anti-CCP (if indicated)
  - **Immunoglobulins**: IgG, IgA, IgM (if recurrent infections)
  - **Stress hormones**: Cortisol (AM level, 4-point salivary if indicated)
- **Imaging**: None routine (chest X-ray if recurrent lung infections)
- **Functional tests**: None routine (HRV may reflect stress response)
- **Patient reports**: Frequency/duration of infections, chronic inflammatory symptoms, stress resilience

**Business value**: Chronic inflammation drives most chronic diseases (cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cancer, Alzheimer's). Immune dysfunction = frequent illness, slow recovery, poor vaccine response. Optimizing immune function = better healthspan.

---

### 8. **Reproductive and Hormonal System (Hệ Sinh Sản - Nội Tiết)**
**What it controls**: Sex hormones, reproductive health, sexual function, fertility, reproductive cancer screening

**How we assess it**:
- **History**: Menstrual cycle regularity (women), sexual function, libido, menopausal symptoms, erectile function (men), prostate symptoms (men), cancer screening history
- **Physical exam**: Breast examination (women), pelvic exam (women, as indicated), testicular exam (men), prostate exam (men, as indicated), signs of hormonal imbalance
- **Labs**:
  - **Sex hormones**: Testosterone (total and free), estradiol, progesterone (women, cycle-dependent), FSH, LH
  - **Other hormones**: DHEA-S, SHBG (sex hormone-binding globulin), prolactin (if indicated)
- **Imaging**:
  - **Women**: Mammography (breast cancer screening), pelvic ultrasound (uterus, ovaries)
  - **Men**: Testicular ultrasound (if indicated), prostate ultrasound (if indicated)
  - **Both**: DEXA scan (hormones affect bone density)
- **Functional tests**: None routine
- **Patient reports**: Sexual function, hormonal symptoms (hot flashes, mood changes, energy), menstrual regularity

**Business value**: Hormonal health affects energy, body composition, mood, bone density, cardiovascular risk, and quality of life. Early reproductive cancer screening (breast, cervical, prostate, testicular) is lifesaving. Sexual function is a key quality-of-life metric often overlooked in traditional care.

## The 3 Clinical Domains (How We Assess Each System)

For EACH of the 8 systems, we evaluate across 3 domains:

### 1. **Structure (Cấu Trúc)** - The "Hardware"
**What it is**: Anatomy, physical structure, organ integrity

**Assessment tools**: Imaging (X-ray, MRI, CT, ultrasound, echocardiography), physical examination

**Examples**:
- Cardiovascular Structure: Echocardiogram showing left ventricular hypertrophy (thickened heart wall)
- Musculoskeletal Structure: MRI showing meniscal tear in knee
- Metabolic Structure: Ultrasound showing fatty liver

---

### 2. **Function (Chức Năng)** - The "Performance"
**What it is**: How the system performs in daily life - capacity, symptoms, functional limitations

**Assessment tools**: Functional testing (walk tests, strength tests, balance), patient-reported outcomes (symptoms, energy, pain)

**Examples**:
- Cardiovascular Function: Can only climb 1 flight of stairs before breathlessness (reduced capacity)
- Musculoskeletal Function: Sit-to-stand test = 8 reps in 30 seconds (below normal)
- Neurological Function: Sleep quality 4/10, waking 3-4 times per night

---

### 3. **Risk (Nguy Cơ)** - The "Future Trajectory"
**What it is**: Forward-looking markers that predict future health problems

**Assessment tools**: Laboratory testing (blood work), risk calculators (ASCVD risk score, FRAX fracture risk)

**Examples**:
- Cardiovascular Risk: A1c 6.3% (prediabetes), ASCVD 10-year risk 12% (moderate-high)
- Musculoskeletal Risk: DEXA scan T-score -2.2 (osteopenia - low bone density, fracture risk)
- Metabolic Risk: Fasting insulin 18 (elevated - insulin resistance)

---

## The Health Matrix Dashboard

All assessment data is organized into an **8 × 3 matrix** = **24 cells**:

```
                    STRUCTURE    FUNCTION    RISK
Neurological           ⚫           ⚫          ⚫
Cardiovascular         ⚫           ⚫          ⚫
Respiratory            ⚫           ⚫          ⚫
Metabolic              ⚫           ⚫          ⚫
Filtration             ⚫           ⚫          ⚫
Musculoskeletal        ⚫           ⚫          ⚫
Immune                 ⚫           ⚫          ⚫
Reproductive/Hormonal  ⚫           ⚫          ⚫
```

Each circle gets a **traffic-light color**:
- 🟢 **Green**: Optimal or on target
- 🟡 **Yellow**: Watch zone - monitor
- 🟠 **Orange**: Action needed - moderate priority
- 🔴 **Red**: High priority - immediate intervention

## Clinical Example: Executive with Fatigue and Weight Gain

**Chief Complaint**: "Always tired, gaining weight, trouble sleeping"

### Assessment Findings Mapped to Health Matrix:

| System | Structure | Function | Risk |
|--------|-----------|----------|------|
| **Neurological** | 🟢 Green (no structural issues) | 🟠 **Orange** (sleep 5-6 hrs, fragmented, energy 4/10) | 🟡 Yellow (no major risk markers) |
| **Cardiovascular** | 🟡 Yellow (mild LVH on echo) | 🟠 **Orange** (BP 138/86, stairs → winded, sedentary) | 🟠 **Orange** (ASCVD 8%, LDL 145, ApoB 110) |
| **Respiratory** | 🟢 Green | 🟡 Yellow (mildly deconditioned) | 🟢 Green |
| **Metabolic** | 🟡 Yellow (fatty liver on ultrasound, 35% body fat) | 🔴 **RED** (energy crashes, post-meal fatigue, waist 104cm) | 🔴 **RED** (A1c 6.3%, fasting insulin 18, triglycerides 220) |
| **Filtration** | 🟢 Green | 🟢 Green | 🟢 Green |
| **Musculoskeletal** | 🟢 Green | 🟡 Yellow (lower back stiffness, sit-to-stand 9 reps) | 🟢 Green |
| **Immune** | 🟢 Green | 🟡 Yellow (2-3 colds/year) | 🟢 Green |

### Priority List (Based on Traffic Lights):
1. 🔴 **Metabolic Function + Risk** (prediabetes, insulin resistance, fatty liver, energy instability)
2. 🟠 **Neurological Function** (sleep deprivation)
3. 🟠 **Cardiovascular Function + Risk** (elevated BP, sedentary, lipids)

### Key Insight (Business Value):
These three problems are **interconnected**:
- Poor sleep → worsens insulin resistance and raises BP
- Insulin resistance → energy crashes and fat accumulation
- Sedentary lifestyle → worsens all of the above

**Traditional approach**: Three separate doctors (endocrinologist for prediabetes, cardiologist for BP, sleep specialist for insomnia)

**Performance Medicine approach**: ONE unified prescription that addresses all three simultaneously:
- **Sleep anchor** 10:30pm-6:30am → improves neurological function, helps BP, improves insulin sensitivity
- **Post-meal walks** 10 min → improves glucose disposal, builds cardiovascular capacity
- **Protein-forward meals** → stabilizes energy, supports metabolic health
- **Home BP monitoring** → track cardiovascular response
- **Metformin** consideration if lifestyle insufficient after 12 weeks

## Business Value Proposition

### 1. **Comprehensive = Nothing Missed**
**Traditional medicine**: siloed specialists, fragmented care, things fall through cracks

**Performance Medicine**: systematic 8-system review ensures comprehensive evaluation

### 2. **Integrated = Root Cause Solutions**
**Traditional medicine**: treat symptoms in isolation (BP med, metformin, sleep pill)

**Performance Medicine**: unified prescription addresses interconnected root causes

### 3. **Measurable = Clear Progress Tracking**
The Health Matrix dashboard provides:
- **Baseline snapshot** (where are we now?)
- **Clear targets** (where do we want to be?)
- **Progress tracking** (are we getting there?)
- **Traffic-light prioritization** (what needs attention now?)

### 4. **Patient-Centered = Lived Experience**
We don't just track lab values—we track **capacity, resilience, flexibility**:
- Can you finish your workday without crashing? (Capacity)
- How quickly do you recover from a hard week? (Resilience)
- Can you handle travel or schedule changes? (Flexibility)

### 5. **Preventive = Early Intervention**
The Risk domain identifies problems BEFORE they become diseases:
- Prediabetes → prevent diabetes
- Elevated ApoB → prevent heart attack
- Low bone density → prevent fractures
