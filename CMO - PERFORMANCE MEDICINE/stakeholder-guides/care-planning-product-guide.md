## What Is the Performance Medicine Care Planning System?

### The Core Concept

Performance Medicine creates **comprehensive, personalized care plans** that:

1. **Start with the patient's goal** - "Play with grandkids," "Run a marathon," "Travel in retirement," "Manage chronic disease while thriving at work"
2. **Assess 8 health systems comprehensively** - Not just labs, but structure (anatomy), function (daily performance), and risk (future outcomes)
3. **Integrate life stage priorities** - Age-appropriate clinical goals that synergize with personal goals (e.g., cardiovascular disease prevention at age 55 supports goal to travel extensively in retirement)
4. **Include ALL evidence-based preventive care** - USPSTF Grade A/B recommendations mapped to the patient's age, sex, and risk factors (so nothing falls through the cracks)
5. **Deliver a unified prescription** - Medical interventions (medications, procedures) AND lifestyle actions (movement, nutrition, sleep, stress management, environment) in one integrated plan
6. **Break it into manageable quarters** - Detailed 3-month plan (Q1) with evolving 12-month roadmap (Q2-Q4) to avoid overwhelm
7. **Track performance, not just disease** - Capacity (what you can do today), Resilience (how quickly you recover), Flexibility (how well you adapt) alongside traditional risk markers

### The Care Plan Document

The care plan is a **written, patient-facing document** (typically 8-15 pages) that includes:

- **Patient's personal health goal** (center point)
- **Life stage context** (what clinical priorities matter at this age)
- **Health Matrix assessment summary** (8 systems × 3 domains, traffic-light visualization)
- **Preventive care checklist** (what screenings/vaccinations are due, current, or not applicable)
- **Unified Q1 care plan** (medical + lifestyle, organized by health system)
- **Q2-Q4 roadmap** (evolving plan based on Q1 progress)
- **Monitoring plan** (metrics we're tracking, follow-up schedule)
- **Educational resources** (guides, apps, support contacts)

The patient **leaves the visit with this document in hand** - a complete roadmap for their health for the next 12 months.

## Why This Matters to Patients

### The Problem with Traditional Care

**Traditional primary care**:
- ❌ Reactive (wait until disease appears, then treat)
- ❌ Fragmented (cardiologist manages heart, endocrinologist manages diabetes, no one coordinates)
- ❌ Disease-focused (success = controlled blood pressure, not "can you do what you want in life?")
- ❌ No plan (you get prescriptions, but no roadmap)
- ❌ Lifestyle as afterthought ("eat better and exercise more" with no specifics)

**Patient experience**:
- "My doctor says my numbers are fine, but I feel terrible."
- "I'm on 6 medications, but no one has explained the overall plan."
- "I know I should exercise, but what exactly should I do?"
- "I have no idea what screenings I need or when."
- "My care feels like whack-a-mole - treat one thing, another pops up."

### The Performance Medicine Solution

**Performance Medicine care planning**:
- ✅ **Proactive** (optimize performance and prevent disease before it starts)
- ✅ **Integrated** (all 8 health systems assessed and coordinated in one plan)
- ✅ **Performance-focused** (success = you can do what matters in your life, not just controlled labs)
- ✅ **Comprehensive plan** (12-month roadmap you can see and follow)
- ✅ **Lifestyle as medicine** (movement, nutrition, sleep, stress management integrated with equal weight to medications)

**Patient experience**:
- "My doctor understands what I want to do with my life and built my plan around that."
- "I can see exactly what we're working on, why, and what success looks like."
- "I have a specific prescription for exercise, nutrition, and sleep - not just vague advice."
- "Nothing falls through the cracks - preventive care, chronic disease, performance goals all in one plan."
- "My care feels coordinated and intentional, not reactive."

### Patient Attraction Value

Patients choose Performance Medicine because:

1. **They feel heard** - The plan starts with THEIR goal, not the doctor's agenda
2. **They get clarity** - 12-month roadmap vs. ambiguous "come back in 6 months"
3. **They get actionable guidance** - Specific lifestyle prescriptions (not "eat healthy and exercise")
4. **They don't fall through cracks** - Preventive care systematically tracked
5. **They see the big picture** - How all their health systems connect, not siloed organ-by-organ care
6. **They achieve more** - Capacity, resilience, flexibility improve (not just risk markers)

**This is what patients are willing to pay for** - comprehensive, coordinated, proactive, performance-focused care with a clear plan.

## How the System Works: Overview for BD/MD Teams

### Step 1: Comprehensive Health Assessment (Initial Visit)

**What happens**:
- **Intake**: Patient completes intake forms (demographics, medical history, goals)
- **Visit**: Provider conducts comprehensive assessment
  - Detailed history (8 systems review + lifestyle pillars)
  - Complete physical examination (8 systems)
  - Laboratory testing (comprehensive panels for risk + function)
  - Imaging (as indicated by age, risk factors, symptoms)
  - Functional testing (6-minute walk, sit-to-stand, grip strength, etc.)
  - Patient-reported outcomes (energy, sleep, pain, quality of life)

**Time**: Typically 60-90 minutes for initial comprehensive assessment

**Output**: Complete data set for Health Matrix analysis (8 systems × 3 domains = 24 assessment cells)

### Step 2: AI-Enabled Care Plan Generation

**What happens**:
- Provider inputs assessment data into Performance Medicine AI system
- AI processes data through structured logic:
  1. **Life stage assignment** (matches patient age to 1 of 9 life stages)
  2. **Health Matrix analysis** (assigns traffic-light status to each of 24 cells)
  3. **Priority system identification** (identifies top 2-3 systems needing intervention)
  4. **Preventive care mapping** (matches patient to USPSTF recommendations based on age/sex/risk)
  5. **Goal synthesis** (connects patient's personal goal to life stage priorities and priority systems)
  6. **Intervention generation** (creates unified prescription: medical + lifestyle for each priority system)
  7. **Metrics selection** (chooses capacity/resilience/flexibility metrics tied to goal)
  8. **Quarterly structuring** (detailed Q1 plan + evolving Q2-Q4 roadmap)

**Time**: AI generates draft care plan in minutes; provider reviews, refines, and finalizes (10-20 minutes)

**Output**: Complete, personalized 12-month care plan document ready to review with patient

### Step 3: Care Plan Review Visit

**What happens**:
- Provider reviews care plan with patient section by section
- Patient asks questions, discusses concerns
- Provider adjusts plan based on patient preferences, barriers, priorities
- Patient signs care plan (agreement to participate)
- Patient receives final copy (digital + printed)

**Time**: 30-45 minutes

**Output**: Patient leaves with comprehensive care plan document, clear next steps, and confidence

### Step 4: Quarterly Follow-Up & Plan Refinement

**What happens**:
- **Q1 (Month 3)**: Comprehensive reassessment
  - Re-evaluate Health Matrix (repeat labs, functional tests, patient-reported outcomes)
  - Assess adherence to Q1 plan
  - Refine Q2 plan based on progress

- **Q2 (Month 6)**: Comprehensive reassessment
  - Update Health Matrix
  - Adjust medications/interventions based on response
  - Refine Q3 plan

- **Q3 (Month 9)**: Check-in visit (can be telehealth)
  - Track progress toward annual goal
  - Troubleshoot barriers
  - Refine Q4 plan

- **Q4 (Month 12)**: Annual comprehensive reassessment
  - Full Health Matrix re-evaluation
  - Celebrate progress
  - Set next year's goals and create new 12-month plan

**Between visits**: Patient tracks daily/weekly metrics (energy, sleep, adherence) via app or portal; messages care team with questions

## The 8 Health Systems + 3 Domains Framework (Quick Reference)

This is the organizing structure for all assessment and care planning.

### 8 Health Systems

1. **Neurological** - Sleep, attention, mood, cognition, autonomic regulation, pain processing
2. **Cardiovascular** - Blood pressure, heart rate, circulation, exercise tolerance
3. **Respiratory** - Breathing capacity, oxygen saturation, airway health
4. **Metabolic/Digestive** - Glucose regulation, lipid metabolism, gut health, energy production (includes thyroid, insulin)
5. **Filtration/Urinary** - Kidney function, fluid/electrolyte balance, toxin clearance
6. **Musculoskeletal** - Strength, mobility, bone density, pain-free movement
7. **Immune** - Infection resistance, inflammatory control, recovery from illness (includes stress hormones: cortisol, catecholamines)
8. **Reproductive/Hormonal** - Sex hormones, reproductive health, sexual function, reproductive cancer screening

### 3 Clinical Domains

- **Structure (Cấu Trúc)** - The anatomy/hardware (Is the organ healthy? Any structural damage?)
- **Function (Chức Năng)** - Daily performance (How well does it work right now? Can you do what you need to do?)
- **Risk (Nguy Cơ)** - Future outcomes (What's your risk of disease or decline in the future?)

### Traffic Light Status

Each of the 24 cells (8 systems × 3 domains) receives a status:
- 🟢 **Green (Optimal)** - No concerns, maintain current state
- 🟡 **Yellow (Watch)** - Mild abnormalities or early warning signs, monitor closely
- 🟠 **Orange (Action Needed)** - Moderate abnormalities or functional limitations, intervene now
- 🔴 **Red (High Priority)** - Severe abnormalities or acute concerns, urgent intervention

**Priority systems** (top 2-3 focus areas) are identified based on number of Orange/Red cells.

---

## Life Stage Health Goals Framework (Quick Reference)

Performance Medicine recognizes that **clinical priorities change across the lifespan**. The care plan integrates age-appropriate clinical goals that synergize with personal goals.

### 9 Life Stages

**Pediatric**:
1. **Infancy (0-1 year)** - Rapid growth, feeding, bonding, developmental milestones, vaccinations
2. **Early Childhood (2-5 years)** - Motor development, language, social skills, injury prevention
3. **Middle Childhood (6-12 years)** - Skill building, peer relationships, healthy habits, school performance

**Adult**:
4. **Adolescence & Young Adulthood (13-25 years)** - Identity formation, risk behavior prevention, mental health, establishing healthy habits
5. **Early Adulthood (26-39 years)** - Performance optimization, reproductive health, stress management, injury prevention
6. **Middle Adulthood (40-54 years)** - Chronic disease risk reduction, functional capacity preservation, cancer screening
7. **Late Middle Age (55-64 years)** - Aggressive CVD prevention, functional capacity preservation, bone health, cancer screening
8. **Older Adulthood (65-79 years)** - Functional independence, fall prevention, chronic disease management, cognitive preservation
9. **Advanced Age (80+ years)** - Quality of life, symptom management, functional capacity, reducing burden of care

Each stage has **specific clinical priorities** (e.g., "Aggressive cardiovascular disease prevention" for Stage 7) that the AI automatically pulls into the care plan based on patient age.

---

## Preventive Care Integration (Quick Reference)

Performance Medicine systematically integrates **all USPSTF Grade A/B recommendations** into care plans based on patient age, sex, and risk factors.

**Key preventive care by age** (abbreviated):

**Ages 18-39**:
- Blood pressure screening (every visit)
- Diabetes screening (if BMI ≥25 or risk factors)
- Cervical cancer screening (women, Pap + HPV every 5 years)
- STI screening (if sexually active)
- Depression screening
- Obesity screening + behavioral counseling
- Tobacco/alcohol screening + cessation counseling

**Ages 40-49**:
- All of above, PLUS:
- Lipid screening (every 5 years)
- Breast cancer screening (women, mammography - some guidelines start at 40, USPSTF says 50)

**Ages 50-64**:
- All of above, PLUS:
- Colorectal cancer screening (colonoscopy every 10 years or FIT annually)
- Lung cancer screening (low-dose CT annually if 50-80 with 20 pack-year smoking history)
- Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) screening (men 65-75 who ever smoked, one-time ultrasound)

**Ages 65-79**:
- All of above, PLUS:
- Osteoporosis screening (DEXA scan for women 65+, men 70+)
- Fall risk assessment
- Cognitive screening (if concerns)
- Advance care planning discussions

**Ages 80+**:
- Individualized preventive care (discuss risks/benefits of screening vs. quality of life)

**The AI automatically generates a checklist** for each patient showing what's due, current, or not applicable.

## The Unified Prescription: Medical + Lifestyle Integration

Traditional care separates medical interventions (medications, procedures) from lifestyle advice. Performance Medicine integrates both into **one unified prescription**.

### Medical Interventions

**Medications**: Evidence-based pharmacotherapy for priority systems
- Example: Atorvastatin 20mg nightly for elevated LDL (cardiovascular risk reduction)

**Procedures/Screenings**: Diagnostic or preventive procedures
- Example: Colonoscopy for colorectal cancer screening (overdue)

**Supplements**: Evidence-based supplementation for deficiencies or specific indications
- Example: Vitamin D3 2000 IU daily (current level 22 ng/mL, target >30)

### Lifestyle Prescription (5 Pillars)

#### 1. Movement (Musculoskeletal, Cardiovascular, Metabolic systems)
**Specific prescription includes**:
- **Strength training**: Frequency (e.g., 2x/week), duration (30-40 min), exercises (squats, push-ups, rows), intensity (progressive load)
- **Aerobic training**: Frequency (3-4x/week), duration (20-30 min), type (walking, cycling), intensity (Zone 2 = can talk in sentences)
- **Daily movement target**: Steps per day (e.g., 8,000 steps), active minutes, break up sitting every hour

**Purpose**: Build muscle mass, improve insulin sensitivity, increase cardiovascular capacity

#### 2. Nutrition (Metabolic, Cardiovascular, Musculoskeletal, Immune systems)
**Specific prescription includes**:
- **Protein target**: Grams per day (e.g., 100g), distribution across meals (25-30g per meal)
- **Meal timing**: Eating window (e.g., 7am-7pm, 12-hour window), stop eating by [time]
- **Fiber target**: Grams per day (25-30g), food sources (vegetables, whole grains, legumes)
- **Macronutrient targets**: If diabetes, CVD, or performance goal (e.g., carb cycling, higher protein)
- **Hydration**: Liters per day (2-3L), timing (front-load to avoid nighttime urination)

**Purpose**: Support muscle building, metabolic control, cardiovascular health, gut health

#### 3. Sleep & Recovery (Neurological, Immune, Metabolic systems)
**Specific prescription includes**:
- **Sleep window**: Bedtime and wake time (e.g., 10:30pm-6:30am), consistent every day (including weekends)
- **Sleep hygiene**: No screens 60 min before bed, bedroom temperature (65-68°F), blackout curtains, white noise
- **Recovery days**: Frequency (e.g., 1 full rest day per week), active recovery vs. complete rest

**Purpose**: Improve sleep consistency, support HRV recovery, reduce daytime fatigue, enable tissue repair

#### 4. Mental & Emotional Health (Neurological, Immune systems)
**Specific prescription includes**:
- **Stress management**: Daily practice (e.g., 10 min breathwork, meditation), specific technique (box breathing, Headspace app)
- **Mood tracking**: Daily or weekly (0-10 scale), tool (journal, app like Daylio or Bearable)
- **Cognitive tools**: If attention/executive function impaired (e.g., Pomodoro technique, task batching)
- **Therapy**: If indicated (CBT, EMDR, etc.)

**Purpose**: Lower sympathetic tone, improve HRV, support mood, enhance cognitive function

#### 5. Surroundings & Social Context (All systems - enablers)
**Specific prescription includes**:
- **Light exposure**: Morning outdoor light (10-15 min within 1 hour of waking) for circadian health
- **Ergonomics**: Workstation assessment (standing desk, monitor height, chair support) for musculoskeletal health
- **Social connection**: Frequency (e.g., 2 social activities per week), type (walk with friend, family dinner, hobby group)
- **Air quality**: If respiratory or immune concerns (air purifier, reduce allergen exposure)
- **Temperature**: Sleep environment, cold exposure (if applicable)

**Purpose**: Support circadian rhythm, reduce pain, improve adherence through social support, optimize respiratory/immune function

## Quarterly Structure: Avoiding Overwhelm

One of the most important features of Performance Medicine care planning is the **quarterly breakdown**.

### Why Quarterly?

**Problem**: Handing a patient a 12-month plan with 50 action items is overwhelming → patient does nothing (analysis paralysis).

**Solution**: Break the plan into **quarterly themes** with 2-3 priorities per quarter.

### Typical Quarterly Progression

**Q1 (Months 1-3): Foundation**
- **Focus**: Establish baseline capacity, address highest-priority risks, build sustainable habits
- **Detail level**: Highly detailed and specific (patient knows exactly what to do)
- **Examples**:
  - Start medications for high-priority risk markers
  - Complete overdue preventive care (colonoscopy, mammography)
  - Establish sleep window, movement routine, nutrition targets
  - Build capacity baseline (functional tests, patient-reported outcomes)

**Q2 (Months 4-6): Build**
- **Focus**: Increase training volume/intensity, optimize interventions, expand capacity
- **Detail level**: Evolving roadmap (refined at Q1 reassessment based on progress)
- **Examples**:
  - Increase strength training frequency (2x → 3x per week)
  - Add interval training if cardiovascular capacity improved
  - Adjust medications based on Q1 lab response
  - Address secondary priority systems if primary systems stabilized

**Q3 (Months 7-9): Optimize**
- **Focus**: Fine-tune performance, address marginal gains, challenge the system
- **Detail level**: Evolving roadmap (refined at Q2 reassessment)
- **Examples**:
  - Experiment with metabolic flexibility (longer fasting windows, carb cycling)
  - Add challenging training stimuli (hill sprints, heavy lifts)
  - Taper medications if targets achieved and sustained
  - Focus on resilience and flexibility metrics

**Q4 (Months 10-12): Sustain**
- **Focus**: Maintain gains, prepare for next year's goals, celebrate progress
- **Detail level**: Evolving roadmap (refined at Q3 check-in)
- **Examples**:
  - Maintain training volume, focus on consistency
  - Lock in sustainable habits for long-term adherence
  - Complete annual preventive care
  - Set next year's goals (often more ambitious now that capacity improved)

### Key Principle: Evolving Roadmap

- **Q1 plan is detailed** (patient leaves initial visit knowing exactly what to do for 3 months)
- **Q2-Q4 plans are intentionally vague** (will be refined at each quarterly follow-up based on actual progress)
- **This prevents overwhelm** while still showing the patient there's a long-term vision

**Example language in care plan**:
> **Quarter 2 (Months 4-6): Build (Evolving Roadmap)**
>
> Focus: Increase training volume, optimize medications based on Q1 response
>
> Projected targets:
> - Increase strength training to 3x/week with progressive load
> - Add interval training 1x/week (if cardiovascular capacity improved)
> - Taper atorvastatin if LDL <70 and no side effects
> - Focus on metabolic flexibility (experiment with 14-16 hour fasting windows)
>
> **Note**: This plan will evolve based on your Q1 progress. We'll refine Q2 at your 3-month follow-up.

## Tracking Performance: Capacity, Resilience, Flexibility

Performance Medicine tracks **performance outcomes** alongside traditional risk markers.

### Capacity: What You Can Do Today

**Functional capacity measures**:
- 6-minute walk test (distance in 6 minutes)
- Sit-to-stand test (reps in 30 seconds)
- Grip strength (kg)
- Stairs climbed without breathlessness
- Balance tests (single-leg stand time, tandem walk)

**Patient-reported capacity measures**:
- Energy level (0-10 scale, morning and afternoon)
- Sleep quality (0-10 scale)
- Pain interference (0-10 scale)
- Activity tolerance (can complete desired activities without payback)

**Example**:
> **Baseline**: Energy 4/10 by 2pm, 6-minute walk 380m, sit-to-stand 9 reps
> **Target**: Energy 7/10 through full day, 6-minute walk >400m, sit-to-stand ≥12 reps

### Resilience: How Quickly You Recover

**Recovery time measures**:
- Heart rate recovery (HR drop 1 minute after stopping exercise)
- Post-exertion fatigue duration (hours/days to return to baseline energy)
- Sleep latency after stress (can you still fall asleep on a hard day?)
- Illness duration (how quickly you recover from colds)

**Pattern stability measures**:
- Day-to-day energy variability (consistent 7/10 vs. swinging 3-9/10)
- Sleep consistency (same bedtime/wake time across nights)
- Pain pattern predictability (stable baseline vs. frequent flares)

**Example**:
> **Baseline**: Post-run fatigue 2-3 days, HR recovery 15 bpm drop, injury every 6-8 weeks
> **Target**: Post-run fatigue <24 hours, HR recovery ≥25 bpm drop, zero injuries in 12 weeks

### Flexibility: How Well You Adapt

**Metabolic flexibility**:
- Fasted state comfort (can skip breakfast without crashing?)
- Post-meal glucose stability (quick return to baseline)

**Training flexibility**:
- Cross-modal performance (can do strength AND endurance without breaking down)
- Recovery from varied stimuli (heat, cold, novel movements)

**Stress flexibility**:
- HRV responsiveness (HRV drops with stress but recovers quickly)
- Mood regulation across life disruptions

**Example**:
> **Baseline**: Must eat within 30 min of waking (crashes if fasted), HRV 40ms (low variability)
> **Target**: Can delay breakfast 2-3 hours comfortably, HRV >60ms with good variability

### Why This Matters

**Traditional medicine**: "Your A1c is 7.2%, blood pressure is 135/85, LDL is 130. We need to get those numbers down."

**Performance Medicine**: "Your A1c, blood pressure, and cholesterol are elevated, which increases your long-term risk. But more importantly, you told me you want to play with your grandkids without getting tired. Right now, your 6-minute walk test shows you're below normal for your age, your energy crashes by 2pm, and it takes you 2-3 days to recover from exertion. Let's build your capacity, resilience, and flexibility so you can do what matters to you - and along the way, we'll improve those risk markers too."

**Patients care more about performance than risk markers** - the care plan speaks their language.

## Positioning This for Patients: Key Messages

When BD teams or medical directors explain Performance Medicine care planning to prospective patients, emphasize:

### 1. "Your Goal Is the Center Point"

**Message**: "We start with what YOU want to accomplish - travel, play with grandkids, run a marathon, manage your chronic disease while thriving at work. Then we build your entire health plan around that goal."

**Why this resonates**: Patients feel heard and valued. Their priorities drive the plan, not the doctor's agenda.

### 2. "You Get a Complete Roadmap"

**Message**: "You'll leave your visit with a comprehensive 12-month care plan in hand. You'll know exactly what we're working on, why it matters, what success looks like, and how we'll get there. No more guessing."

**Why this resonates**: Clarity and transparency. Patients are tired of ambiguous "come back in 6 months" with no plan.

### 3. "Nothing Falls Through the Cracks"

**Message**: "We systematically track all evidence-based preventive care (cancer screenings, vaccinations, cardiovascular risk) so you never miss anything. It's all integrated into your plan."

**Why this resonates**: Peace of mind. Patients worry about missing important screenings or tests - this reassures them.

### 4. "Medical + Lifestyle, Integrated"

**Message**: "Your plan integrates medications AND specific lifestyle prescriptions (movement, nutrition, sleep, stress management) into one unified prescription. We don't just say 'eat better' - we give you a specific plan."

**Why this resonates**: Actionable guidance. Patients want to do the right thing but don't know how - this gives them the tools.

### 5. "We Track Performance, Not Just Disease"

**Message**: "We don't just measure your cholesterol and blood pressure - we measure what you can DO. Can you walk without getting tired? Do you have energy through the day? How quickly do you recover? We track capacity, resilience, and flexibility alongside traditional risk markers."

**Why this resonates**: This is what patients actually care about - lived experience, not just lab values.

### 6. "Manageable, Not Overwhelming"

**Message**: "We break your plan into quarterly themes with 2-3 priorities per quarter. You won't be overwhelmed with 50 things to do at once. We focus on what matters most first, build capacity, then progress."

**Why this resonates**: Reduces fear and overwhelm. Patients have tried and failed with overly ambitious plans before - this feels doable.

### 7. "Coordinated Across All Your Health Systems"

**Message**: "We assess 8 core health systems (neurological, cardiovascular, respiratory, metabolic, musculoskeletal, immune, reproductive/hormonal, filtration) and coordinate care across all of them. No more siloed care where your cardiologist doesn't talk to your endocrinologist."

**Why this resonates**: Frustration with fragmented care is universal. This promises integration and coordination.

## Common Patient Questions & Answers for BD Teams

### Q: "How is this different from concierge medicine?"

**A**: Concierge medicine typically offers **longer visit times and better access** (same-day appointments, direct cell phone access to doctor), but often uses the **same reactive, disease-focused care model** - just with more time and convenience.

Performance Medicine offers a **fundamentally different clinical model**:
- **Proactive, not reactive** (optimize performance and prevent disease, not wait-and-treat)
- **Performance-focused, not just disease-focused** (capacity, resilience, flexibility are clinical endpoints)
- **Comprehensive care planning** (12-month roadmap, not visit-by-visit care)
- **Lifestyle as medicine** (integrated prescription, not afterthought advice)

You get the **best of both**: the access and time of concierge medicine PLUS a superior clinical model focused on performance and prevention.

### Q: "Do you take insurance?"

**A**: *(This will depend on your specific practice model - adjust accordingly)*

Performance Medicine is typically a **hybrid model**:
- **Comprehensive assessments, care planning, and quarterly follow-ups** are membership/out-of-pocket (not typically covered by insurance because they exceed standard visit times and include extensive care coordination)
- **Labs, imaging, procedures, and medications** are often billable to insurance (we'll maximize your insurance benefits for these)
- **Some practices** participate with insurance for standard visits but charge a separate care planning fee

We provide **superbills** (detailed receipts) that you can submit to your insurance for potential reimbursement if you have out-of-network benefits.

### Q: "How much time does this require from me?"

**A**:
- **Initial comprehensive assessment**: 60-90 minutes
- **Care plan review visit**: 30-45 minutes
- **Quarterly follow-ups**: 30-60 minutes (Q1 and Q2 are longer, Q3 can be brief telehealth)
- **Daily time investment**: Varies by plan, but typically:
  - Movement: 30-60 min/day (includes daily walk + 2-3 structured workouts per week)
  - Nutrition: Meal planning/prep time (varies, but front-loaded - gets easier over time)
  - Sleep: 7-9 hours + 30 min wind-down routine
  - Stress management: 10-15 min/day
  - Tracking: 2-5 min/day (energy, sleep, adherence in app)

**Total**: Less time than most people spend scrolling social media, but vastly more impactful for health and quality of life.

### Q: "What if I can't follow the plan perfectly?"

**A**: **Perfection is not the goal** - progress is. The plan is designed to be **flexible and adaptive**:
- We focus on **2-3 priorities per quarter**, not 50 things at once
- We **adjust based on your real-life constraints** (travel, work schedule, family demands)
- We **celebrate progress**, not punish imperfection
- **Adherence itself is tracked and troubleshot** - if something isn't working, we modify the plan

The goal is **sustainable improvement**, not short-term perfection that leads to burnout.

### Q: "I'm already seeing a cardiologist / endocrinologist / etc. Do I still need them?"

**A**: Performance Medicine is designed to **coordinate with specialists**, not replace them. Here's how it works:

- **For stable chronic conditions** (e.g., well-controlled diabetes, hypertension): Performance Medicine can often **manage these comprehensively** without needing ongoing specialist visits (we'll co-manage with your specialist or transition care if appropriate)

- **For complex or unstable conditions** (e.g., heart failure, advanced kidney disease, difficult-to-control diabetes): You'll **continue seeing your specialist**, and Performance Medicine will **coordinate** - we'll communicate with your specialist, integrate their recommendations into your unified care plan, and ensure lifestyle interventions support medical management

- **For acute issues** (e.g., you need a cardiac catheterization, joint replacement): Performance Medicine will **refer to specialists** and then **reintegrate you** into comprehensive care once acute issue is resolved

**The key difference**: Even if you see specialists, **Performance Medicine is the quarterback** - we coordinate everything, ensure nothing falls through cracks, and keep your care aligned with your personal health goals.

### Q: "What if I just want to optimize performance, not manage disease?"

**A**: Perfect - that's what Performance Medicine was designed for. Many patients come to us **before disease develops**:
- **Athletes** wanting to optimize training, recovery, and performance
- **High performers** (executives, physicians, entrepreneurs) wanting to maintain peak cognitive and physical capacity under high stress
- **Younger patients** wanting to establish healthy habits and prevent disease proactively

Your care plan will focus on:
- **Capacity building** (strength, endurance, cognitive function)
- **Resilience optimization** (faster recovery, stress adaptation)
- **Flexibility enhancement** (metabolic flexibility, training adaptability)
- **Preventive care** (ensure you're up to date on age-appropriate screenings)

No disease diagnosis required - **performance optimization is the goal itself**.

## Next Steps for BD Teams

1. **Master the key messages** (7 positioning points above) - practice explaining them conversationally
2. **Understand the 8 systems × 3 domains framework** (use the traffic-light visualization - it's intuitive)
3. **Review example care plans** (ask Medical Director for de-identified samples)
4. **Role-play common patient questions** (practice Q&A until responses feel natural)
5. **Emphasize the care plan document itself** (show prospective patients what they'll receive - it's tangible value)

**Key BD strategy**: Let the care plan document do the selling. When prospects see a comprehensive, personalized 12-month roadmap (vs. a prescription and "see you in 6 months"), the value is immediately obvious.
