# Physical Examination Standard in Performance Medicine - For Business Development

## Overview for Business Development

The **physical examination** is one of the core components of the comprehensive health assessment in Performance Medicine. It's the hands-on, in-person evaluation performed by a physician that assesses structure, function, and capacity across all 8 health systems.

**Key Message**: This is a **thorough, systematic, physician-level examination** that goes beyond a basic "check-up." It's comparable to what you'd receive at top executive health programs (Mayo Clinic, Cleveland Clinic) but organized through the Performance Medicine framework.

## What's Included in the Physical Examination?

The physical exam includes:
1. **Vital Signs and Biometrics** - Foundational measurements
2. **General Appearance Assessment** - Overall health status observation
3. **System-by-System Examination** - Detailed assessment of all 8 health systems
4. **Functional Capacity Testing** - Performance-based assessments

**Duration**: 30-45 minutes for comprehensive initial exam

## 1. Vital Signs and Biometrics

### Vital Signs (Standard Medical Measurements)
- **Blood Pressure** (seated, both arms on initial visit)
  - Normal: <120/80 mmHg
  - Elevated: 120-129/<80 mmHg
  - Stage 1 Hypertension: 130-139/80-89 mmHg
  - Stage 2 Hypertension: ≥140/90 mmHg
  - *Why it matters*: Early detection of cardiovascular risk

- **Heart Rate** (resting, regularity)
  - Normal resting: 60-100 beats per minute
  - Athletic: 40-60 beats per minute
  - *Why it matters*: Cardiovascular fitness and autonomic function

- **Respiratory Rate**
  - Normal: 12-20 breaths per minute
  - *Why it matters*: Respiratory and metabolic health

- **Oxygen Saturation (SpO2)**
  - Normal: ≥95% at rest
  - *Why it matters*: Lung function and oxygen delivery

- **Temperature** (if indicated by symptoms)
  - Normal: 97.0-99.0°F (36.1-37.2°C)

### Biometric Measurements (Body Composition Indicators)
- **Height and Weight** → BMI calculation
  - BMI <18.5: Underweight
  - BMI 18.5-24.9: Normal
  - BMI 25-29.9: Overweight
  - BMI ≥30: Obese
  - *Note*: BMI has limitations (doesn't distinguish muscle vs fat)

- **Waist Circumference** (metabolic risk indicator)
  - Men: >102 cm (40 inches) = increased risk
  - Women: >88 cm (35 inches) = increased risk
  - *Why it matters*: Visceral fat (abdominal fat) predicts diabetes and heart disease risk

- **Hip Circumference** → Waist-to-Hip Ratio
  - Men: >0.90 = increased risk
  - Women: >0.85 = increased risk
  - *Why it matters*: Body fat distribution affects metabolic health

- **Body Composition** (if available - DEXA scan, bioimpedance analysis)
  - Lean muscle mass
  - Body fat percentage
  - Visceral fat
  - Bone density

**Business Value**: These baseline measurements are objective, trackable, and universally understood. They provide clear "before and after" metrics for demonstrating progress.

## 2. General Appearance Assessment

**What the physician observes**:
- Overall health status (well-appearing vs. ill-appearing)
- Body habitus and proportions
- Level of distress (comfortable, anxious, in pain)
- Grooming and hygiene
- Gait and posture (before formal examination)
- Skin color (pallor, jaundice, cyanosis)

**Why it matters**: First impression often reveals important clues (e.g., labored breathing, apparent pain, weight loss, muscle wasting, tremor, posture suggesting chronic pain).

**Business Value**: Early reproductive cancer detection (breast, testicular, prostate, cervical) is lifesaving and significantly improves survival rates. Hormonal health affects energy, mood, body composition, bone density, cardiovascular risk, and quality of life. Sexual function is a critical but often-overlooked quality-of-life metric. Addressing hormonal imbalances can dramatically improve patient well-being across multiple health domains.

  - Normal: >12 bpm drop in first minute
  - *What it measures*: Cardiovascular fitness, autonomic function

### Musculoskeletal Function
- **Sit-to-stand test**: Repetitions in 30 or 60 seconds
  - Age 60-64: Normal ≥14 reps (30 sec)
  - *What it measures*: Lower body strength, fall risk

- **Grip strength**: Dynamometer measurement
  - Men: Normal 40-50 kg
  - Women: Normal 25-35 kg
  - *What it measures*: Overall strength, mortality predictor

## What Makes Performance Medicine Physical Exam Different?

### Traditional Physical Exam:
- Focus: Disease detection
- Scope: Basic vital signs, targeted system exam based on chief complaint
- Outcome: Normal or abnormal findings
- Duration: 10-15 minutes

### Performance Medicine Physical Exam:
- Focus: Disease detection + functional capacity assessment + performance optimization
- Scope: Comprehensive 8-system exam + functional testing
- Outcome: Health Matrix dashboard (Structure, Function, Risk for each system) with traffic-light status
- Duration: 30-45 minutes
- Integration: Findings mapped to capacity, resilience, flexibility targets

**Example**: Traditional exam might say "knee exam normal, no swelling or tenderness." Performance Medicine exam adds: "Sit-to-stand 10 reps (below age norm), reports stiffness after sitting, limited by function not structure → Target: improve lower body strength and mobility."

---

## Documentation and Reporting

After the physical examination, the patient receives:

1. **Health Matrix Dashboard** - Visual display of all 24 cells (8 systems × 3 domains) with traffic-light colors
2. **Detailed Findings Report** - Documentation of all exam findings
3. **Functional Capacity Summary** - Performance on all functional tests with age/sex norms
4. **Priority List** - Red/Orange/Yellow/Green status for each system
5. **Unified Prescription** - Medical and lifestyle interventions based on findings

**Business Value**: Clear, visual reporting makes complex medical data understandable and actionable for patients.

---

## Quality Standards

Performance Medicine physical examinations follow:
- **American College of Physicians (ACP)** standards for internal medicine physical exam
- **American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP)** comprehensive exam guidelines
- **American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM)** guidelines for functional fitness assessment
- **USPSTF (U.S. Preventive Services Task Force)** screening recommendations

All physical examinations are performed by:
- **Board-certified physicians** (MD/DO)
- Licensed in the appropriate state
- With training in Performance Medicine methodology

---

## Frequency and Follow-Up

### Initial Comprehensive Exam:
- Duration: 30-45 minutes
- When: First visit, annually, or when health status changes significantly

### Follow-Up Focused Exams:
- Duration: 15-20 minutes
- When: Based on traffic-light priorities
  - **Red priorities**: 2-4 weeks (reassess targeted systems)
  - **Orange priorities**: 4-12 weeks
  - **Yellow/Green**: 3-6 months (maintenance)

### Components Repeated at Follow-Up:
- Vital signs (every visit)
- Targeted system exam (based on priorities)
