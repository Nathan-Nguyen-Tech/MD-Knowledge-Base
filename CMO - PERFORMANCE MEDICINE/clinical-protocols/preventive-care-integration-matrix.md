# Preventive Care Integration Matrix

## Overview

This document integrates **USPSTF Grade A and B recommendations** (evidence-based preventive services with high-certainty net benefit) into the **8 Health Systems Framework** of Performance Medicine.

**Purpose**: Ensure that preventive care is systematically integrated into every patient's care plan based on age, sex, and risk factors, mapped directly to the Health Matrix dashboard.

---

## USPSTF Grading System (Quick Reference)

- **Grade A**: High certainty of substantial net benefit. Clinicians should offer/provide this service.
- **Grade B**: High certainty of moderate net benefit, OR moderate certainty of moderate-to-substantial net benefit. Clinicians should offer/provide this service.

**This document includes only Grade A and B recommendations** - services proven to improve health outcomes.

## Integration with the Health Matrix Dashboard

### How Preventive Care Populates the Health Matrix

Each USPSTF recommendation maps to a **specific Health System and Domain**:

**Example: 55-year-old woman**

| Health System | Domain | Preventive Care Item | Status |
|---------------|--------|---------------------|--------|
| **Cardiovascular** | Risk | • BP screening (annual)<br>• Lipid panel (every 5 years)<br>• ASCVD risk score | 🟢 BP 118/76<br>🟢 LDL 95<br>🟢 ASCVD 3.2% |
| **Metabolic** | Risk | • A1c screening (overweight)<br>• Colorectal cancer screening (age 50-75) | 🟡 A1c 5.9% (prediabetes)<br>🟢 Colonoscopy done 2023 |
| **Reproductive/Hormonal** | Risk | • Mammography (biennial)<br>• Cervical cancer screening (every 5 years) | 🟢 Mammogram done 2024<br>🟢 Pap + HPV 2022 |
| **Musculoskeletal** | Risk | • DEXA scan not yet due (age 65+) | 🟢 Not yet indicated |
| **Respiratory** | Risk | • Tobacco screening<br>• Lung cancer screening (if 20 pack-years) | 🟢 Never smoker |
| **Neurological** | Function | • Depression screening | 🟢 PHQ-9 = 2 (minimal) |
| **Immune** | Risk | • HIV screening (one-time)<br>• Hepatitis C screening (one-time) | 🟢 HIV neg 2020<br>🟢 Hep C neg 2023 |

**Result**: Dashboard shows **one Yellow (prediabetes)** → Triggers lifestyle intervention plan.

## Clinical Workflow: Preventive Care Integration

### Step 1: Age and Risk Stratification
- Identify patient age bracket
- Identify risk factors (family history, comorbidities, lifestyle)

### Step 2: Generate Preventive Care Checklist
- Pull USPSTF A/B recommendations for age + sex + risk factors
- Map to 8 Health Systems

### Step 3: Check Completion Status
- Which screenings are due?
- Which are up to date?
- Which have abnormal results requiring follow-up?

### Step 4: Populate Health Matrix
- Assign preventive care results to appropriate system/domain
- Use traffic-light status (Green/Yellow/Orange/Red)

### Step 5: Create Unified Prescription
- Overdue screenings → Schedule
- Abnormal results → Intervention plan (medical + lifestyle)
- Upcoming screenings → Patient education and preparation

---

## Quarterly Preventive Care Review

At each quarterly visit, review:

1. **Due screenings** - What's coming up in next 3-6 months?
2. **Overdue screenings** - What needs to be scheduled immediately?
3. **Abnormal results** - What needs intervention or follow-up?
4. **Vaccination status** - What's due based on age and risk?

**Goal**: No preventive care item falls through the cracks. Every A/B recommendation integrated into care plan.

---

## Summary

**The Preventive Care Integration Matrix ensures**:
- USPSTF Grade A/B recommendations systematically applied
- Age-based and risk-based screening integrated into 8 Health Systems
- Preventive care mapped to Health Matrix dashboard for visibility
- No screening gaps—everything tracked and monitored
- Clear workflow from screening → result → intervention → follow-up

**This is comprehensive, evidence-based preventive medicine** - not an afterthought, but a core component of every care plan.
