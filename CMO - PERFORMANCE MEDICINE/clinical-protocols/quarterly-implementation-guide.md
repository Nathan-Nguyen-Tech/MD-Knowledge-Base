# Quarterly Implementation Guide

## Overview

This guide provides **tactical, practical guidance** for implementing each quarterly phase of the Performance Medicine care plan. While [comprehensive-care-planning-methodology.md](comprehensive-care-planning-methodology.md) explains the overall workflow, this document zooms in on **how to execute Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4** with patients in real-world practice.

**Target Audience**: Providers, health coaches, care coordinators implementing quarterly care plans with patients.

**Purpose**: Provide phase-specific protocols, patient education scripts, troubleshooting guidance, and progression criteria for each quarter.

---

## The Quarterly Progression Model

### Conceptual Framework

Performance Medicine care plans follow a **quarterly progression** designed to:
1. **Avoid overwhelm** (patients can't execute 50 action items at once)
2. **Build progressively** (establish foundation → increase challenge → optimize → sustain)
3. **Adapt based on response** (refine plan every 3 months based on actual progress)

### The Four Themes

| Quarter | Theme | Focus | Detail Level |
|---------|-------|-------|--------------|
| **Q1 (Months 1-3)** | **Foundation** | Establish baseline capacity, address highest-priority risks, build sustainable habits | Highly detailed, specific prescriptions |
| **Q2 (Months 4-6)** | **Build** | Increase training volume/intensity, optimize interventions based on Q1 response, expand capacity | Detailed (refined at Q1 follow-up) |
| **Q3 (Months 7-9)** | **Optimize** | Fine-tune performance, experiment with metabolic flexibility, challenge the system | Moderate detail (refined at Q2 follow-up) |
| **Q4 (Months 10-12)** | **Sustain** | Maintain gains, lock in sustainable habits, prepare for next year | Moderate detail (refined at Q3 follow-up) |

### Key Principle: Evolving Detail

- **Q1 plan is prescribed in full detail** at initial visit → Patient knows exactly what to do for 3 months
- **Q2-Q4 plans are intentionally vague** at initial visit → Refined at each quarterly follow-up based on actual progress
- **This prevents overwhelm** while showing the patient there's a long-term vision

---

## Q1 (MONTHS 1-3): FOUNDATION

### Theme: Establish Baseline Capacity, Address Highest-Priority Risks, Build Sustainable Habits

### Objectives

**Primary goals**:
1. **Stabilize high-risk conditions** (start medications, address acute concerns, complete overdue screenings)
2. **Establish keystone habits** (sleep window, daily movement, protein target, stress management practice)
3. **Build baseline capacity** (improve functional tests, patient-reported outcomes)
4. **Demonstrate early wins** (patients need to FEEL better quickly to stay engaged)

**What success looks like at Week 12**:
- Patient has consistent habits (sleep, movement, nutrition basics)
- High-priority risk markers moving in right direction (LDL dropping, A1c dropping, BP dropping)
- Capacity improving (energy better, functional tests improved, patient-reported outcomes better)
- Patient feels confident, not overwhelmed ("I can do this")

### Week-by-Week Guidance

#### Weeks 1-2: Launch & Early Troubleshooting

**Provider actions**:
- **Week 2 phone check-in (15 minutes)**: "How are the first two weeks going? What's working? What's hard?"

**Common early barriers**:
- **Medication side effects** (e.g., statin muscle aches, metformin GI upset): Troubleshoot (take with food, switch to extended-release, try different statin, etc.)
- **Habit friction** (forgetting to take meds, can't get to gym): Problem-solve (set phone alarms, pill organizer, home workout alternatives)
- **Overwhelm** ("This is too much"): Simplify - identify 1-2 keystone habits to focus on for now, add more later

**Patient education focus**:
- **Expectations**: "It's normal for the first 2 weeks to feel hard. You're building new habits. It gets easier."
- **Keystone habits**: If overwhelmed, focus on:
  1. **Sleep window consistency** (same bedtime/wake time every day)
  2. **Daily movement** (even just 10-minute walk)
  - Everything else can layer on top once these are established

**Red flags requiring immediate follow-up**:
- Severe medication side effects
- Inability to complete basic activities of daily living
- Acute symptoms (chest pain, severe shortness of breath, etc.) → direct to ED or urgent visit

#### Weeks 3-6: Building Momentum

**Provider actions**:
- **Week 6 visit (30 minutes)**: Brief check-in, assess adherence, adjust plan if needed

**Week 6 visit structure**:
1. **Review adherence** (10 minutes):
   - For each intervention (meds, movement, nutrition, sleep, etc.): "On a scale of 0-10, how consistently have you been doing this?"
   - Celebrate what's working: "You've been consistent with your sleep window - that's huge. How does it feel?"
   - Troubleshoot what's not: "Strength training has been hard - what's getting in the way?"

2. **Spot-check metrics** (10 minutes):
   - Patient-reported outcomes: "How's your energy? Sleep quality? Pain?"
   - Quick functional check if time allows (doesn't need to be formal 6MWT, but observe: Can they walk comfortably? Stand from chair easily?)
   - No labs yet (too early to see risk marker changes)

3. **Adjust plan if needed** (10 minutes):
   - If adherence is good and patient feels confident → stay the course
   - If adherence is poor → simplify (reduce scope, focus on fewer things)
   - If specific intervention isn't working → adjust (different exercise, different meal timing, etc.)

**Common mid-Q1 issues**:
- **Plateau or frustration** ("I'm doing everything but I don't see results yet"): Reassure that risk marker changes take 8-12 weeks to show up in labs, but functional capacity should be improving - track patient-reported energy, sleep, etc.
- **Injury or illness** (got a cold, tweaked knee): Adjust plan temporarily (reduce training intensity, focus on recovery), reassure this doesn't derail the whole plan
- **Life disruption** (work travel, family emergency): Help patient identify minimum viable plan during disruption (e.g., just maintain sleep window and daily walk, pause strength training for 1-2 weeks)

#### Weeks 7-12: Solidifying Habits & Preparing for Reassessment

**Provider actions**:
- **No scheduled visit**, but patient should message with questions or concerns
- **Week 10-11: Pre-reassessment lab orders**: Order labs so results are ready for Week 12 visit

**Patient focus**:
- **Habit consolidation**: By this point, Q1 interventions should feel more automatic, less effortful
- **Building confidence**: Patient should see improvement in patient-reported outcomes (energy, sleep, pain, mood)
- **Anticipation**: Patient should be curious about Week 12 reassessment ("How much have my numbers improved?")

**Common late-Q1 issues**:
- **Boredom** (same workout routine, same meals): Reassure that Q2 will add variety and progression; for now, focus on consistency
- **Temptation to do more** (patient feels good, wants to add more training): Encourage patience - Q2 is for building, Q1 is for establishing foundation

### Q1 Reassessment (Week 12 / Month 3): Comprehensive Evaluation (60 minutes)

See [comprehensive-care-planning-methodology.md](comprehensive-care-planning-methodology.md) Phase 5 for full protocol.

**Key deliverables**:
1. **Updated Health Matrix**: Compare to baseline, show progress (traffic light colors should shift toward green)
2. **Lab results**: Show changes in risk markers (LDL, A1c, BP, etc.)
3. **Functional test improvements**: Re-do 6MWT, sit-to-stand, grip strength → show objective capacity gains
4. **Patient-reported outcome trends**: Show energy, sleep, pain trends over 12 weeks
5. **Refined Q2 plan**: Now detailed (was vague at initial visit)

**Decision point: Is patient ready for Q2 Build phase?**

**YES, progress to Q2 Build if**:
- Adherence to Q1 plan was ≥70% (doesn't need to be perfect)
- Capacity metrics improved (functional tests, patient-reported outcomes)
- Risk markers stable or improving (even if not at target yet)
- Patient feels confident and ready for more challenge

**NO, repeat Q1 Foundation if**:
- Adherence was <50% (habits not established)
- No improvement in capacity or risk markers
- Patient still feels overwhelmed or unsure
- **Action**: Simplify Q1 plan further, extend Foundation phase another 4-8 weeks, troubleshoot barriers more deeply

**Partially ready (common)**:
- Some things working well, others not
- **Action**: Keep what's working, adjust what's not, progress in some domains while consolidating in others (e.g., progress strength training but keep aerobic training at Q1 level)

### Q1 Clinical Pearls

1. **Sleep is the foundation**: If patient can only do one thing consistently, make it the sleep window. Everything else improves when sleep improves.

2. **Early wins matter**: Patients need to FEEL better quickly (within 2-4 weeks) to stay engaged. Focus on interventions with fast patient-reported outcome improvements (sleep, energy, pain) alongside slower risk marker improvements.

3. **Simplify when overwhelmed**: If patient is struggling, don't add more - simplify. Focus on 1-2 keystone habits. Build confidence with small wins.

4. **Expect non-linear progress**: Some weeks will be better than others. Life happens. The goal is trend, not perfection.

5. **Celebrate process, not just outcomes**: Celebrate that patient is showing up, trying, building habits - not just lab values improving.

## Q2 (MONTHS 4-6): BUILD

### Theme: Increase Training Volume/Intensity, Optimize Interventions, Expand Capacity

### Objectives

**Primary goals**:
1. **Progress training stimulus** (increase volume, intensity, or complexity of movement prescription)
2. **Optimize medical interventions** (titrate medications based on Q1 response, address secondary systems if primary systems stabilized)
3. **Expand capacity** (improve functional tests beyond baseline, push patient-reported outcomes higher)
4. **Build resilience** (faster recovery, more consistent performance day-to-day)

**What success looks like at Month 6**:
- Patient tolerates higher training loads without injury or excessive fatigue
- Risk markers closer to target (may reach target this quarter or next)
- Functional capacity continues improving (6MWT increases, sit-to-stand increases, energy higher)
- Resilience improving (faster recovery after workouts, more stable energy day-to-day)

### Progression Criteria: When & How to Progress

**Movement prescription progression**:

**Strength training**:
- **Q1 baseline**: 2x/week, body weight or light weights, 30-40 min
- **Q2 progression** (if Q1 went well):
  - Increase frequency: 2x → 3x/week
  - Increase load: Body weight → resistance bands or light dumbbells → moderate dumbbells (10% increase per week)
  - Increase complexity: Add unilateral movements (single-leg squats, single-arm rows), add core work

**Aerobic training**:
- **Q1 baseline**: 3-4x/week, 20-30 min, Zone 2 (conversational pace)
- **Q2 progression** (if Q1 went well):
  - Increase duration: 20-30 min → 30-45 min
  - Add intensity variation: 1x/week interval training (e.g., 30 sec hard / 90 sec easy × 8-10 rounds)
  - Increase frequency: 3-4x/week → 4-5x/week (if time allows and recovery is good)

**When NOT to progress**:
- Adherence to Q1 plan was inconsistent (<70%)
- Patient is still recovering slowly (post-workout fatigue >24 hours)
- Injury or pain developed during Q1
- Patient feels overwhelmed or unsure
- **Action**: Consolidate Q1 plan, don't add more yet

**Nutrition prescription progression**:

**Q1 baseline**: 100g protein/day, 12-hour eating window, 25g fiber/day, adequate hydration

**Q2 progression options** (choose based on goals):
- **If metabolic flexibility is a goal**: Experiment with longer fasting windows (14-16 hours, 1-2 days per week)
- **If muscle building is a goal**: Increase protein (1.8-2.2 g/kg body weight), time protein around workouts
- **If cardiovascular risk reduction is a goal**: Emphasize omega-3 rich foods (fatty fish 2-3x/week), increase fiber (30-35g/day)
- **If gut health is a goal**: Add fermented foods daily (yogurt, kefir, sauerkraut, kimchi)

**Sleep prescription progression**:

**Q1 baseline**: 10:30pm-6:30am consistent window

**Q2 progression** (if Q1 sleep was consistent):
- **Optimize sleep quality**: Add morning sunlight exposure (already prescribed in Q1, but reinforce), experiment with sleep environment (temperature, blackout curtains, white noise)
- **Track HRV** (if not already): Use wearable (Whoop, Oura, Garmin) to track heart rate variability as resilience metric, use HRV to guide training (low HRV day = easy training or rest)

**Mental health prescription progression**:

**Q1 baseline**: 10 min daily breathwork or meditation

**Q2 progression options**:
- Increase duration: 10 → 15-20 min daily
- Add cognitive training: If attention/executive function is a goal, add brain training apps (Lumosity, etc.) - NOTE: evidence is mixed, use judiciously
- Add therapy: If mood/stress is still a barrier, refer to therapist (CBT, EMDR, etc.)

### Medical Intervention Adjustments

**Medications**:

**If risk markers improved but not at target**:
- Titrate up (e.g., atorvastatin 20mg → 40mg if LDL is 85 but target is <70)
- Add second agent (e.g., add ezetimibe to statin if LDL still elevated, add ARB to ACE-inhibitor if BP not controlled)

**If risk markers reached target**:
- Continue current dose, monitor (don't change a winning strategy)
- Consider tapering if lifestyle changes are robust and patient wants to try reducing meds (e.g., taper metformin if A1c normalized with weight loss and exercise)

**If risk markers didn't improve or worsened**:
- Assess adherence: Is patient actually taking the medication?
- Switch agents: Try different statin, different BP med, etc.
- Re-evaluate diagnosis: Is there secondary cause? (e.g., hypothyroidism causing high cholesterol, sleep apnea causing high BP)

**Procedures/Screenings**:
- Complete any Q1 procedures that were delayed (colonoscopy, mammography, etc.)
- Address secondary systems: If primary systems are stabilized (e.g., cardiovascular risk controlled), now address secondary concerns (e.g., low vitamin D, subclinical hypothyroidism)

### Q2 Reassessment (Month 6): Comprehensive Evaluation (60 minutes)

**Key deliverables**:
1. **Updated Health Matrix**: Continue tracking progress
2. **Lab results**: Should see more significant changes by Month 6 (LDL should be closer to or at target, A1c improving, etc.)
3. **Functional tests**: Continue tracking 6MWT, sit-to-stand, grip strength - should see continued improvement
4. **Resilience metrics**: Look for faster recovery (heart rate recovery improving, post-workout fatigue decreasing, HRV improving if tracking)
5. **Refined Q3 plan**: Now detailed

**Decision point: Is patient ready for Q3 Optimize phase?**

**YES, progress to Q3 Optimize if**:
- Q2 training volume/intensity was tolerated well
- Capacity continues improving (not just stable, but improving)
- Risk markers at or very close to target
- Patient feels strong, confident, ready for more challenge

**NO, repeat Q2 Build if**:
- Q2 progression was too much (injury, excessive fatigue, poor recovery)
- Capacity plateaued or declined
- Risk markers not responding as expected
- **Action**: Scale back Q2 plan, consolidate at lower intensity/volume, troubleshoot

### Q2 Clinical Pearls

1. **Progressive overload, not random variety**: Progression means increasing stimulus in a controlled way (10% per week rule for volume/load), not just doing random new workouts. Random variety doesn't build capacity - progressive overload does.

2. **Recovery is where adaptation happens**: More training is not always better. If patient is not recovering between sessions (fatigue >24 hours, HRV declining, sleep worsening), reduce volume/intensity - don't add more.

3. **Medication adjustments take time**: Don't change meds every 2 weeks. Give 8-12 weeks to see full effect before adjusting (unless side effects or safety concerns).

4. **Celebrate capacity gains, not just risk marker improvements**: By Q2, patient should FEEL significantly better (more energy, better sleep, less pain). If labs improved but patient feels the same or worse, troubleshoot (medication side effects? overtraining? other issue?).

## Q3 (MONTHS 7-9): OPTIMIZE

### Theme: Fine-Tune Performance, Experiment with Metabolic Flexibility, Challenge the System

### Objectives

**Primary goals**:
1. **Fine-tune performance** (address marginal gains, optimize weak links)
2. **Experiment with flexibility** (metabolic flexibility, training flexibility, stress adaptability)
3. **Challenge the system** (introduce novel stimuli, test limits)
4. **Prepare for long-term sustainability** (identify what's truly sustainable vs. unsustainable long-term)

**What success looks like at Month 9**:
- Patient has achieved or nearly achieved primary goal (if goal was time-bound)
- Capacity is significantly higher than baseline (functional tests, patient-reported outcomes)
- Resilience is robust (fast recovery, consistent performance)
- Flexibility is emerging (can handle fasting, training variety, schedule disruptions without decompensating)
- Risk markers at target (or patient understands why not and has plan to get there)

### Optimization Strategies

**Metabolic flexibility**:

**Q1-Q2 baseline**: 12-hour eating window (e.g., 7am-7pm)

**Q3 experimentation** (if metabolic health is a focus):
- **Longer fasting windows**: 14-16 hours, 2-3 days per week (e.g., skip breakfast on non-training days)
- **Carbohydrate cycling**: Higher carbs on training days, lower carbs on rest days (if performance-focused)
- **Periodic longer fasts**: 24-hour fast once per month (if experienced with fasting and no contraindications)
- **Track subjective response**: "How do you feel fasted? Energy stable? Able to focus? Or do you crash?" Adjust based on response.

**Training flexibility**:

**Q1-Q2 baseline**: Structured strength + aerobic training

**Q3 experimentation**:
- **Cross-training**: Add different modalities (swimming, cycling, rowing, hiking, yoga, martial arts) to build broader fitness base
- **Unstructured play**: One session per week of "just move" - play basketball, dance, hike, climb - no structure, just enjoy movement
- **Environmental stressors**: If safe and patient is interested, experiment with heat (sauna), cold (cold plunges, ice baths), altitude (if accessible)
- **Purpose**: Build anti-fragility, prevent boredom, discover new activities patient enjoys

**Performance fine-tuning**:

**Identify weak links**:
- Is there one functional test lagging behind? (e.g., 6MWT improved 20%, but sit-to-stand only improved 5% → focus on lower extremity strength)
- Is there one system still not optimal? (e.g., cardiovascular and metabolic systems are green, but musculoskeletal is still yellow → add more mobility work, address persistent pain)

**Address marginal gains**:
- Sleep optimization: Experiment with sleep tracking, wake-up light, sleep supplements (magnesium, glycine, etc.) if needed
- Recovery optimization: Add massage, foam rolling, contrast baths, etc. if helpful
- Nutrient timing: If performance-focused, dial in pre/post-workout nutrition

**When NOT to optimize**:
- If Q2 goals not yet achieved (don't jump ahead - consolidate first)
- If patient is fatigued or burned out (back off, focus on recovery)
- If life stressors are high (job stress, family issues, etc.) - this is not the time to add more challenge

### Q3 Check-In (Month 9): Brief Visit (30 minutes, can be telehealth)

**This is a lighter touch** - no comprehensive reassessment unless something changed.

**Visit structure**:
1. **Review Q3 adherence & experimentation** (10 minutes):
   - "How did the Q3 experiments go? What worked? What didn't?"
   - "Are you still tolerating the training load, or do you feel overtrained?"

2. **Spot-check metrics** (10 minutes):
   - Patient-reported outcomes (energy, sleep, pain, mood, stress)
   - Quick functional check (doesn't need formal testing, just ask: "How's your movement? Any pain or limitations?")
   - No labs unless something changed

3. **Refine Q4 plan** (5 minutes):
   - Q4 theme is Sustain → focus on what's sustainable long-term
   - "What parts of this plan do you see yourself doing for the rest of your life? What feels like a short-term experiment that you'll drop?"

4. **Preview annual reassessment** (5 minutes):
   - "We'll do a full reassessment at Month 12 - repeat labs, functional tests, Health Matrix. We'll celebrate your progress and set next year's goals."

### Q3 Clinical Pearls

1. **Optimization is not for everyone**: Some patients are happy with "good enough" (risk markers controlled, capacity improved, habits established). Don't push optimization if patient is content with current state. Q3 is for patients who want to go further.

2. **Experimentation requires recovery**: You can't experiment with fasting, cold exposure, and high-intensity interval training all at once. Pick one experiment at a time, run it for 2-4 weeks, assess response, adjust.

3. **Flexibility is about resilience to variability**: The goal of Q3 experiments is to make the patient more anti-fragile - able to handle life disruptions (travel, busy weeks, occasional poor sleep) without falling apart.

4. **Know when to back off**: If patient is showing signs of overtraining (declining performance, poor sleep, elevated resting HR, low HRV, mood changes), Q3 should be a deload, not further optimization.

---

## Q4 (MONTHS 10-12): SUSTAIN

### Theme: Maintain Gains, Lock In Sustainable Habits, Prepare for Next Year

### Objectives

**Primary goals**:
1. **Maintain capacity and risk marker improvements** (don't lose progress)
2. **Identify sustainable long-term habits** (what will patient keep doing for years?)
3. **Taper unsustainable interventions** (if patient was doing something short-term just to hit a goal, wind it down)
4. **Prepare for annual reassessment and next year's goals** (reflect, celebrate, plan ahead)

**What success looks like at Month 12**:
- Patient has maintained or continued improving capacity and risk markers
- Patient has clarity on what habits are sustainable ("I'll do this forever") vs. what was short-term
- Patient feels confident, not dependent (can maintain health without constant provider hand-holding)
- Patient is excited about next year's goals (not burned out)

### Sustainability Assessment

**For each intervention, ask: "Will you keep doing this long-term?"**

**Movement**:
- Strength training 3x/week → Sustainable for patient's life? Or will they scale back to 2x/week maintenance?
- Aerobic training 4-5x/week → Sustainable? Or will they settle at 3x/week?
- Daily walk target (8,000 steps) → Sustainable?

**Nutrition**:
- Protein target (100g/day) → Sustainable? Or does it feel like too much effort to track?
- 12-hour eating window → Sustainable? Or will patient go back to 14-hour window?
- Specific dietary patterns (low-carb, Mediterranean, etc.) → Sustainable?

**Sleep**:
- 10:30pm-6:30am sleep window → Sustainable? (This should be YES - sleep is non-negotiable)

**Mental health**:
- 10-15 min daily meditation → Sustainable? Or will patient reduce to 5 min or 3x/week?

**Medical interventions**:
- Medications: Will patient stay on long-term? Or try tapering if risk markers sustained?
- Supplements: Are these necessary long-term, or were they just for repletion (e.g., vitamin D loaded, now can reduce dose)?

**Create two lists**:

**Tier 1: Non-negotiables** (will do for life):
- Example: Sleep window, daily walk, strength training 2x/week minimum, medications for high-risk conditions

**Tier 2: Flexible** (will do when life allows, but okay to drop during high-stress periods):
- Example: Strength training 3rd session, longer fasting windows, daily meditation (may reduce to 3x/week)

**This clarity helps patient sustain gains long-term** without feeling like they must maintain 100% intensity forever (which leads to burnout).

### Q4 Annual Reassessment (Month 12): Comprehensive Evaluation (60 minutes)

See [comprehensive-care-planning-methodology.md](comprehensive-care-planning-methodology.md) Phase 6 for full protocol.

**Key deliverables**:
1. **Full Health Matrix re-evaluation**: Complete assessment (history, exam, labs, imaging, functional tests, patient-reported outcomes)
2. **Side-by-side comparison to baseline** (Month 0 vs. Month 12):
   - Health Matrix traffic lights (show shifts from red/orange → yellow/green)
   - Lab values (LDL baseline vs. Month 12, A1c baseline vs. Month 12, etc.)
   - Functional tests (6MWT baseline vs. Month 12, sit-to-stand baseline vs. Month 12, grip strength, balance)
   - Patient-reported outcomes (energy baseline vs. Month 12, sleep, pain, mood, QOL)

3. **Celebrate progress**:
   - "Look at this: Your LDL went from 142 to 68. Your 6-minute walk went from 380m to 480m - that's a 26% increase. Your energy went from 4/10 to 8/10. This is incredible progress."
   - **Even if not all goals achieved**, celebrate what WAS achieved

4. **Reflect on year**:
   - "What did you learn about yourself this year?"
   - "What worked well? What didn't?"
   - "Did you achieve your original goal? If yes, how does it feel? If no, what got in the way?"

5. **Set next year's goals**:
   - "What do you want to focus on for the next year?"
   - Often, Year 2 goals are more ambitious (patient has capacity now to aim higher)
   - Examples:
     - Year 1 goal: "Finish workday without crashing" (maintenance) → Year 2 goal: "Run a 5K" (performance)
     - Year 1 goal: "Get diabetes under control" (disease management) → Year 2 goal: "Come off metformin" (reverse disease)

6. **Generate new 12-month care plan** using same methodology (this becomes Year 2 Q1 plan)

### Q4 Clinical Pearls

1. **Sustain doesn't mean coast**: Maintenance requires effort - just less effort than building. Patient can scale back intensity but must stay consistent.

2. **Identify minimum effective dose**: What's the least amount of intervention needed to maintain progress? (e.g., maybe patient can maintain muscle with 2x/week strength training instead of 3x/week)

3. **Prevent burnout**: If patient feels exhausted by end of Year 1, Q4 should be a recovery quarter (reduce volume, focus on enjoyment, rebuild motivation for Year 2).

4. **Year 2 goals can be bolder**: Once patient has built capacity and confidence in Year 1, Year 2 can be more ambitious. Don't let patient plateau - encourage growth if they're ready.

5. **Long-term adherence > short-term perfection**: The patient who does "pretty good" for 10 years will have better outcomes than the patient who does "perfect" for 6 months then quits.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues Across All Quarters

### Issue: Poor Adherence

**Possible causes**:
- Plan is too complex or overwhelming
- Patient doesn't understand WHY they're doing something (lack of goal connection)
- Barriers patient didn't anticipate (cost, time, access, family dynamics, etc.)
- Depression, anxiety, or other mental health issue
- Lack of social support or accountability

**Solutions**:
- Simplify plan (reduce to 1-2 keystone habits)
- Reconnect intervention to patient's personal goal ("Here's how this helps you achieve [goal]")
- Problem-solve barriers (lower-cost alternatives, time-saving strategies, family involvement, etc.)
- Address mental health (refer to therapy, consider medication if indicated)
- Add accountability (health coach check-ins, group visits, app-based tracking with provider visibility)

### Issue: Plateau (No Further Progress)

**Possible causes**:
- Stimulus is no longer sufficient (patient adapted, now needs more challenge)
- Adherence dropped (patient thinks they're doing the plan, but actual adherence is <50%)
- Insufficient recovery (overtraining, poor sleep, high life stress)
- Medical issue not yet addressed (undiagnosed hypothyroidism, sleep apnea, etc.)
- Patient is at their genetic/physiological limit (rare, but possible)

**Solutions**:
- Increase training stimulus (progressive overload)
- Reassess actual adherence (use tracking data, not just patient self-report)
- Increase recovery (deload week, improve sleep, reduce life stress if possible)
- Rule out medical issues (thyroid panel, sleep study, etc.)
- If true physiological limit, shift goal to maintenance

### Issue: Injury or Pain

**Possible causes**:
- Progressed too fast (violated 10% rule)
- Poor movement mechanics (form issues in strength training)
- Inadequate warm-up or mobility work
- Overtraining (insufficient recovery between sessions)
- Undiagnosed structural issue (arthritis, labral tear, etc.)

**Solutions**:
- Scale back training volume/intensity (10-20% reduction)
- Refer to physical therapy for movement assessment and correction
- Add mobility work and warm-up protocols
- Increase recovery time (reduce frequency or add rest days)
- Imaging if persistent pain despite conservative management (X-ray, MRI)

### Issue: Medication Side Effects

**Common issues**:
- Statins → muscle aches, fatigue
- Metformin → GI upset (nausea, diarrhea)
- ACE inhibitors → dry cough
- SSRIs → sexual dysfunction, weight gain

**Solutions**:
- Adjust dosing (take with food, split dose, change time of day)
- Switch to extended-release formulation (metformin ER, etc.)
- Switch to different agent in same class (different statin, ARB instead of ACE-inhibitor, different SSRI)
- Add supplement to counteract side effect (CoQ10 for statin myalgia - evidence is mixed but low risk)
- If side effects persist and outweigh benefits, consider discontinuing and relying more on lifestyle interventions (if safe)

### Issue: Life Disruption (Travel, Family Emergency, Job Change, etc.)

**Approach**:
- **Identify minimum viable plan**: "What's the bare minimum you can do to not lose progress?" (usually: maintain sleep window, daily 10-minute walk, keep taking meds)
- **Temporary pause on progression**: Don't try to build during high-stress periods - just maintain
- **Resume full plan when life stabilizes**: This is not failure - this is real life
- **Reframe**: "The fact that you maintained some habits during a chaotic time is a win. That's resilience."

## Summary: Quarterly Progression at a Glance

| Quarter | Theme | Primary Focus | Movement Example | Nutrition Example | Red Flag: Don't Progress If... |
|---------|-------|---------------|------------------|-------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Q1** | Foundation | Build keystone habits, stabilize high-risk conditions, demonstrate early wins | Strength 2x/week body weight, walking 3-4x/week 20-30 min Zone 2, 8K steps/day | 100g protein/day, 12-hour eating window, 25g fiber/day | Adherence <50%, patient feels overwhelmed |
| **Q2** | Build | Increase training stimulus, optimize medications, expand capacity | Strength 3x/week with load progression, walking 4-5x/week 30-45 min, add 1x/week intervals | Continue Q1 + experiment with 14-16 hour fasting 1-2x/week (if metabolic goal) | Adherence to Q1 <70%, patient not recovering well, injury in Q1 |
| **Q3** | Optimize | Fine-tune performance, experiment with flexibility, challenge the system | Add cross-training variety, experiment with environmental stressors (heat/cold), unstructured play | Experiment with longer fasts (24 hr 1x/month), carb cycling if performance goal | Q2 goals not achieved, patient feels overtrained or burned out, high life stress |
| **Q4** | Sustain | Maintain gains, identify sustainable habits, prepare for Year 2 | Settle into sustainable frequency (maybe 2-3x/week strength, 3-4x/week cardio), focus on enjoyment | Clarify long-term sustainable eating pattern, maintain protein target | Patient losing progress, patient burned out |
