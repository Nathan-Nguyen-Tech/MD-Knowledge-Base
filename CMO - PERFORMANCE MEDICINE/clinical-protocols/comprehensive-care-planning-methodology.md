### Phase 5: Quarterly Follow-Up & Refinement
### Phase 6: Annual Comprehensive Reassessment

---

## PHASE 1: PRE-VISIT PREPARATION

### Objective
Gather baseline data before the visit to maximize visit efficiency and quality.

### Steps

#### 1. Patient Intake Forms (Completed Before Visit)

**Demographics & Insurance**:
- Name, DOB, contact information
- Insurance information (if applicable)
- Emergency contact

**Medical History**:
- Chief complaint or primary health goal
- Past medical history (chronic conditions, surgeries, hospitalizations)
- Current medications (name, dose, frequency)
- Allergies
- Family history (parents, siblings - CVD, cancer, diabetes, neurological disease, etc.)
- Social history (occupation, living situation, marital status, children)
- Health behaviors (tobacco, alcohol, recreational drugs, exercise, diet patterns)

**Review of Systems (8 Health Systems)**:
Use structured questionnaire covering:
- Neurological (sleep, mood, cognition, pain, headaches, dizziness)
- Cardiovascular (chest pain, palpitations, shortness of breath, leg swelling, exercise tolerance)
- Respiratory (shortness of breath, cough, wheezing, chronic sinus issues)
- Metabolic/Digestive (energy levels, appetite, weight changes, GI symptoms, thirst, urination frequency)
- Filtration/Urinary (urination frequency/urgency, blood in urine, kidney stones, swelling)
- Musculoskeletal (joint pain, back pain, stiffness, weakness, falls, mobility limitations)
- Immune (frequency of infections, chronic inflammatory symptoms, autoimmune conditions)
- Reproductive/Hormonal (menstrual history, sexual function, menopausal symptoms, prostate symptoms, hormonal symptoms)

**Lifestyle Assessment (5 Pillars)**:
- Movement: Current exercise routine (type, frequency, duration, intensity), sedentary time, barriers
- Nutrition: Typical daily eating pattern, meal timing, protein intake, vegetable/fiber intake, hydration, barriers
- Sleep: Typical bedtime/wake time, sleep duration, sleep quality, sleep disruptions, nap habits
- Mental/Emotional Health: Stress level (0-10), mood (0-10), anxiety, coping mechanisms, therapy history
- Surroundings/Social: Living environment, work environment, social support, light exposure, ergonomics

**Patient-Reported Outcomes (Baseline)**:
Use standardized 0-10 scales for:
- Energy level (morning and afternoon)
- Sleep quality
- Pain level and pain interference
- Mood
- Stress level
- Quality of life
- Confidence in managing own health

**Health Goal**:
- "What is the #1 health-related goal you want to accomplish?"
- "Why does this matter to you?"
- "What does success look like?"

**Preventive Care History**:
- Dates of last screenings (colonoscopy, mammography, cervical cancer screening, etc.)
- Vaccination history

#### 2. Provider Pre-Visit Review (10-15 minutes)

**Review intake forms**:
- Identify chief complaint or primary goal
- Note high-priority findings (red flags, multiple chronic conditions, high-risk behaviors)
- Note gaps in preventive care
- Formulate initial hypotheses about priority systems

**Prepare assessment strategy**:
- Anticipate which physical exam components will be most important
- Plan which labs/imaging to order
- Prepare patient education topics

**Time-Saving Tip**: Use AI assistant to summarize intake forms and highlight:
- Priority health systems based on symptoms/history
- Preventive care gaps
- Red flags requiring immediate attention

---

## PHASE 2: COMPREHENSIVE HEALTH ASSESSMENT (VISIT 1)

### Objective
Conduct thorough assessment to populate the Health Matrix (8 systems × 3 domains).

### Visit Structure (60-90 minutes)

#### 1. Goal-Setting Conversation (10-15 minutes)

**Explore the patient's health goal**:
- "Tell me about what you want to accomplish with your health."
- "Why does this matter to you right now?"
- "What does success look like? How will you know you've achieved this goal?"
- "What barriers or challenges have you faced in working toward this goal?"

**Clarify goal specificity**:
- If vague ("I want to be healthy"), probe deeper: "What would 'being healthy' allow you to DO that you can't do now?"
- If functional ("I want to play with my grandkids"), quantify: "What specific activities? For how long? Without what symptoms?"
- If performance-based ("I want to run a 5K"), establish timeline and current baseline

**Connect goal to life stage**:
- Briefly acknowledge life stage context: "You're at an age where [cardiovascular disease prevention / functional independence / etc.] becomes really important. The good news is that working on [your goal] and working on [clinical priority] actually support each other."

**Set expectations for the visit**:
- "Today I'm going to do a comprehensive assessment of 8 core health systems. This will help us understand what's working well, what needs attention, and what's putting you at risk down the road."
- "After today's visit, I'll put together a personalized 12-month care plan centered around your goal. We'll review it together [same visit if time allows, or schedule separate 30-45 min visit]."

#### 2. Focused History Deep-Dive (15-20 minutes)

You've already reviewed intake forms. Use this time to:

**Clarify high-priority findings**:
- "You mentioned [symptom] - tell me more about that."
- Probe symptom characteristics (onset, duration, severity, pattern, triggers, relievers)

**Assess functional impact**:
For each high-priority system, ask:
- "How does this affect what you can do day-to-day?"
- "How quickly do you recover after [exertion / stress / illness]?"
- "How consistent is this, or does it vary a lot?"

**Explore lifestyle pillar details**:
- Movement: "Walk me through a typical week of physical activity. What do you enjoy? What have you tried that didn't work?"
- Nutrition: "What does a typical day of eating look like? Breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks? When do you eat your first and last meal?"
- Sleep: "What time do you actually get in bed? What time do lights go out? What time do you wake up? Do you feel rested?"
- Stress: "What are your biggest sources of stress right now? How do you manage stress?"
- Environment: "Tell me about your work setup. Do you sit most of the day? What does your home environment look like?"

**Assess readiness to change**:
- "On a scale of 0-10, how confident are you that you could [make specific behavior change]?"
- "What would make that easier for you?"

#### 3. Physical Examination (20-30 minutes)

Conduct comprehensive physical exam covering all 8 systems. See [physical-examination-standard.md](../stakeholder-guides/physical-examination-standard.md) for complete protocol.

## PHASE 3: DATA ANALYSIS & CARE PLAN GENERATION

### Objective
Analyze assessment data, assign Health Matrix status, identify priorities, and generate unified care plan.

### Timing
- If same-visit review: 15-20 minutes between assessment and care plan review
- If separate visit: Can take more time (30-60 minutes) to create highly detailed plan

### Step-by-Step Process

#### Step 1: Organize Assessment Data

Compile all data into structured format:
- Demographics (age, sex)
- Patient's primary goal
- Medical history (conditions, medications, allergies, family history, social history)
- Review of systems findings (8 systems)
- Physical exam findings (8 systems)
- Functional test results (6MWT, sit-to-stand, grip strength, balance)
- Patient-reported outcomes (energy, sleep, pain, mood, stress, QOL)
- Labs (when available - may populate later if not point-of-care)
- Imaging (when available)

#### Step 2: Assign Health Matrix Status (8 Systems × 3 Domains = 24 Cells)

For each of 8 health systems, assess across 3 domains:

**Structure Domain** (Anatomy/Hardware):
- Review imaging, physical exam structural findings, relevant labs
- Assign status:
  - 🟢 Green: No structural abnormalities
  - 🟡 Yellow: Mild structural changes (e.g., mild arthritis, small fibroid, borderline LVH)
  - 🟠 Orange: Moderate structural abnormalities requiring intervention (e.g., moderate stenosis, significant organomegaly)
  - 🔴 Red: Severe structural damage or acute structural concern (e.g., aneurysm, fracture, severe stenosis)

**Function Domain** (Daily Performance):
- Review functional tests, patient-reported outcomes, physical exam functional findings
- Assign status:
  - 🟢 Green: Function is normal for age; patient can do desired activities without limitation
  - 🟡 Yellow: Function is mildly impaired; patient notices limitation but can compensate
  - 🟠 Orange: Function is moderately impaired; patient has clear limitations in daily activities
  - 🔴 Red: Function is severely impaired; patient cannot perform essential daily activities

**Risk Domain** (Future Outcomes):
- Review risk markers (labs, imaging risk scores, validated risk calculators)
- Assign status:
  - 🟢 Green: Low risk (<10% 10-year risk for CVD; normal metabolic markers; low cancer risk)
  - 🟡 Yellow: Moderate risk (10-20% 10-year CVD risk; prediabetes; some elevated markers)
  - 🟠 Orange: High risk (>20% 10-year CVD risk; diabetes; multiple elevated risk markers)
  - 🔴 Red: Very high risk or established disease (>30% CVD risk; acute event risk; advanced disease)

**Clinical Judgment**: Status assignment requires clinical judgment, not just automated thresholds. Consider:
- Age and sex norms
- Trajectory (improving vs. declining)
- Patient's functional goals (athlete vs. sedentary)
- Clustering of risk factors

#### Step 3: Identify Priority Systems

**Priority level scoring**:
For each health system, count Orange + Red cells:
- 2+ Red cells OR 1 Red + 2+ Orange → **High Priority**
- 1 Red cell OR 2+ Orange cells → **Action Needed**
- 1 Orange OR 2+ Yellow cells → **Watch**
- All Green or mostly Green with 1 Yellow → **Maintain**

**Select top 2-3 priority systems** for Q1 focus:
- Rank systems by priority level
- Consider patient's primary goal (choose systems most relevant to goal if multiple are tied)
- Limit to 2-3 systems to avoid overwhelm

**Clinical Pearl**: More is not better. Trying to address 5-6 systems at once leads to poor adherence. Focus on 2-3, build capacity and adherence, then expand.

#### Step 4: Map Life Stage Clinical Priorities

Based on patient age, pull clinical priorities from [life-stage-health-goals.md](life-stage-health-goals.md).

**Example**:
- Patient age 52 → Life Stage 6 (Middle Adulthood, 40-54)
- Clinical priorities: Chronic disease risk reduction, functional capacity preservation, cancer screening

**Synthesize synergy**:
Connect life stage priorities to patient's personal goal.
- Example: "Chronic disease risk reduction at your age supports your goal to travel in retirement by preventing cardiovascular events that would limit your ability to travel."

#### Step 5: Identify Preventive Care Gaps

Based on patient age, sex, and risk factors, pull recommendations from [preventive-care-integration-matrix.md](preventive-care-integration-matrix.md).

**Cross-reference with patient's preventive care history**:
- Which screenings are due or overdue?
- Which are up to date?
- Which are not applicable?

**Generate checklist**:
- ☐ Colonoscopy - Overdue (last 11 years ago, recommend every 10 years)
- ✅ Mammography - Current (completed 8 months ago, next due in 16 months)
- ☐ Lipid panel - Overdue (last 6 years ago, recommend every 5 years)

#### Step 6: Generate Unified Prescription (Medical + Lifestyle)

For each priority system, prescribe interventions across medical AND lifestyle domains.

**Medical Interventions**:

**Medications**:
- Evidence-based pharmacotherapy for elevated risk markers or symptomatic conditions
- Examples:
  - Statin (if LDL elevated and CVD risk high)
  - Metformin (if prediabetes/diabetes and lifestyle insufficient alone)
  - ACE-inhibitor/ARB (if hypertension)
  - SSRI/SNRI (if depression/anxiety and counseling insufficient)

**Procedures/Screenings**:
- Address preventive care gaps (colonoscopy, mammography, etc.)
- Diagnostic procedures for unclear findings (e.g., echocardiogram if murmur, stress test if chest pain)

**Supplements**:
- Evidence-based supplementation for deficiencies or specific indications
- Examples:
  - Vitamin D3 (if deficient, <30 ng/mL)
  - Omega-3 fatty acids (if high triglycerides or CVD risk and low fish intake)
  - Creatine monohydrate (if muscle building goal and strength training prescribed)
  - Magnesium (if sleep issues or muscle cramps)

**Lifestyle Prescription (5 Pillars)**:

**Movement** (targets Musculoskeletal, Cardiovascular, Metabolic systems):

Prescribe with specificity:
- **Strength training**: Frequency (e.g., 2x/week), duration (30-40 min), exercises (major compound movements: squat, hinge, push, pull), intensity (start with body weight or light resistance, progress 10% per week), rest days
- **Aerobic training**: Frequency (e.g., 3-4x/week), duration (20-30 min), type (walking, cycling, swimming - consider joint limitations), intensity (Zone 2 = conversational pace, 60-70% max HR)
- **Daily movement**: Steps target (e.g., 8,000 steps/day), break up sitting (stand/walk every 60 min for 2 min)
- **Mobility/balance** (if age ≥55 or musculoskeletal limitations): Frequency (daily or 3x/week), type (yoga, tai chi, specific stretches)

**Dose based on**:
- Current capacity (from functional tests)
- Patient goal (general health vs. performance)
- Barriers (joint pain, time constraints, access to equipment)

**Nutrition** (targets Metabolic, Cardiovascular, Musculoskeletal, Immune systems):

Prescribe with specificity:
- **Protein target**: Grams per day (1.6-2.2 g/kg for muscle building; 1.2-1.6 g/kg for maintenance), distribute evenly across meals (25-40g per meal)
- **Meal timing**: Eating window (e.g., 12-hour window, 7am-7pm; or 14-hour if metabolic flexibility goal), stop eating by [time] (3 hours before bed)
- **Fiber target**: Grams per day (25-35g), food sources (vegetables 5+ servings/day, whole grains, legumes, nuts/seeds)
- **Macronutrient targets** (if specific metabolic goal): Carb cycling, higher fat for satiety, etc.
- **Hydration**: Liters per day (2-3L), timing (front-load, most by 5pm to reduce nighttime urination)
- **Specific foods to emphasize**: Fatty fish 2x/week (omega-3), colorful vegetables (antioxidants), fermented foods (gut health)

**Sleep & Recovery** (targets Neurological, Immune, Metabolic systems):

Prescribe with specificity:
- **Sleep window**: Bedtime (e.g., 10:30pm), wake time (6:30am), duration target (7-9 hours), consistency (same every day, including weekends - critical)
- **Sleep hygiene**:
  - No screens 60-90 min before bed
  - Bedroom temperature 65-68°F
  - Blackout curtains or eye mask
  - White noise if needed
  - No caffeine after 2pm
  - No alcohol within 3 hours of bed (disrupts REM sleep)
- **Recovery days**: 1 full rest day per week (no structured exercise, light movement only), deload week every 4th week if high training volume

**Mental & Emotional Health** (targets Neurological, Immune systems):

Prescribe with specificity:
- **Stress management**: Daily practice (10-15 min), specific technique (box breathing 4-4-4-4, body scan meditation, Headspace app, etc.)
- **Mood/energy tracking**: Daily or weekly (0-10 scale), tool (journal, app like Daylio or Bearable), identify patterns
- **Cognitive tools** (if attention/executive function impaired): Pomodoro technique (25 min focus, 5 min break), task batching, minimize distractions
- **Therapy/counseling**: If indicated (CBT for anxiety, EMDR for trauma, etc.), provide referral

**Surroundings & Social Context** (supports all systems):

Prescribe with specificity:
- **Light exposure**: 10-15 min outdoor light within 1 hour of waking (circadian health, mood), minimize blue light evening
- **Ergonomics**: Workstation assessment and modification (standing desk option, monitor at eye level, chair with lumbar support, keyboard/mouse positioning)
- **Social connection**: Frequency (e.g., 2-3 social activities per week), type (walk with friend, family meal, hobby group, faith community)
- **Air quality**: If respiratory or immune concerns (HEPA air purifier, reduce allergen exposure, houseplants)
- **Temperature/cold exposure**: If applicable (cold plunges for recovery, sauna for cardiovascular health - if no contraindications)

#### Step 7: Structure Plan into Quarterly Phases

**Q1 (Months 1-3): Foundation** (highly detailed)
- **Theme**: Establish baseline capacity, address highest-priority risks, build sustainable habits
- **Target systems**: Priority system 1, Priority system 2 (max 3 systems)
- **Medical interventions**: List all medications, procedures, supplements with purpose, target, monitoring
- **Lifestyle prescription**: Specific prescriptions for each of 5 pillars with dosing, frequency, purpose
- **Metrics**: Select 2-4 capacity metrics, 1-2 resilience metrics, 1 flexibility metric tied to patient's goal

**Q2 (Months 4-6): Build** (evolving roadmap)
- **Theme**: Increase training volume/intensity, optimize interventions based on Q1 response
- **Projected targets**: Examples of progression (increase training frequency, adjust medications based on labs, address secondary systems if primary systems stabilized)
- **Note**: "This plan will evolve based on your Q1 progress. We'll refine Q2 at your 3-month follow-up."

**Q3 (Months 7-9): Optimize** (evolving roadmap)
- **Theme**: Fine-tune performance, experiment with metabolic flexibility, challenge the system
- **Projected targets**: Examples (longer fasting windows, interval training, taper medications if targets sustained)

**Q4 (Months 10-12): Sustain** (evolving roadmap)
- **Theme**: Maintain gains, lock in sustainable habits, prepare for next year
- **Projected targets**: Examples (maintain training, complete annual preventive care, set next year's goals)

#### Step 8: Select Monitoring Metrics & Follow-Up Plan

**Capacity metrics** (2-4 metrics tied to goal):
- Functional tests: 6MWT, sit-to-stand, grip strength, stairs, balance
- Patient-reported: Energy (0-10), sleep quality (0-10), pain interference (0-10)
- System-specific: Exercise duration, attention span, etc.

**Resilience metrics** (1-2):
- Heart rate recovery (HR drop 1 min post-exercise)
- Post-exertion fatigue duration (hours to return to baseline)
- Sleep consistency (bedtime variability)
- Illness recovery time

**Flexibility metrics** (1):
- Fasted state comfort (yes/no)
- Training variety tolerance (yes/no)
- HRV trend (if tracking)

**Risk markers** (from priority systems):
- Labs: LDL, A1c, blood pressure, etc.
- Include baseline, target, recheck interval

**Follow-up schedule**:
- Week 2: Phone check-in (15 min) - troubleshoot early barriers
- Week 6: Brief visit (30 min) - assess adherence, adjust if needed
- Week 12: Q1 comprehensive reassessment (60 min) - repeat Health Matrix, refine Q2 plan
- Month 6: Q2 reassessment (60 min) - update Health Matrix, adjust interventions, refine Q3 plan
- Month 9: Q3 check-in (30 min, can be telehealth) - track progress, refine Q4 plan
- Month 12: Annual comprehensive reassessment (60 min) - full Health Matrix, celebrate progress, set next year goals

#### Step 9: Populate Care Plan Template

Use the [care-plan-template-structure.md](care-plan-template-structure.md) and fill all `[INPUT]` fields with generated content.

**Sections**:
1. Patient information & goals
2. Life stage context & clinical priorities
3. Health Matrix assessment summary
4. Preventive care checklist
5. Unified care plan (quarterly breakdown)
6. Monitoring & follow-up plan
7. Patient education & resources

**AI-Assisted Workflow**:
If using AI system, input structured assessment data → AI populates template → Provider reviews, refines, and approves.

**Manual Workflow**:
Provider manually completes template using word processor or EMR template.

## PHASE 4: CARE PLAN REVIEW & FINALIZATION (VISIT 2 OR SAME VISIT)

### Objective
Review care plan with patient, address questions, adjust based on preferences/barriers, obtain agreement.

### Visit Structure (30-45 minutes)

#### 1. Introduction (2 minutes)

**Set the stage**:
- "I've put together a comprehensive 12-month care plan centered around your goal to [patient's goal]."
- "We're going to review it section by section. I want you to ask questions, tell me if something doesn't make sense, or if you see barriers."
- "This is a living document - we'll adjust it based on your feedback today and refine it every quarter based on your progress."

#### 2. Review Section 1: Patient Goals (3 minutes)

**Read back patient's goal**:
- "You told me your #1 goal is [goal]. Is that still accurate?"
- "Here's how we'll measure success: [success metrics]. Does that feel right to you?"

**Adjust if needed** based on patient feedback.

#### 3. Review Section 2: Life Stage Context (5 minutes)

**Explain life stage priorities**:
- "You're in [life stage name], which is a time when [clinical priorities] become really important."
- "Here's why these priorities support your personal goal: [synergy explanation]."

**Assess patient buy-in**:
- "Does this make sense to you? Do you see how preventing [e.g., heart disease] now supports your goal to [e.g., travel in retirement]?"

#### 4. Review Section 3: Health Matrix Assessment Summary (8-10 minutes)

**Show traffic light visualization**:
- "Here's a snapshot of your 8 health systems across structure, function, and risk."
- "Green means optimal, yellow means watch, orange means we need to act, red means high priority."

**Highlight priority systems**:
- "Based on your assessment, we're focusing on [priority system 1] and [priority system 2] first."
- "Here's what we found: [brief summary of findings for each priority system]."
- "Here's why this matters for your goal: [goal connection]."

**Discuss non-priority systems**:
- "These other systems are mostly green or yellow - we're not ignoring them, but they don't need active intervention right now. We'll keep monitoring."

**Assess patient questions**:
- "What questions do you have about this assessment?"
- Address any concerns or confusion.

#### 5. Review Section 4: Preventive Care Checklist (3 minutes)

**Show what's due**:
- "Based on your age and risk factors, here's what preventive care you need: [list due items]."
- "Let's get these scheduled." (Provide orders, scheduling instructions)

**Reassure on what's current**:
- "The good news is [list current items] are up to date."

#### 6. Review Section 5: Unified Care Plan - Q1 in Detail (12-15 minutes)

**This is the most important section** - go slowly and ensure understanding.

**Explain quarterly structure**:
- "We're breaking your plan into quarterly phases. Q1 is highly detailed - you'll know exactly what to do for the next 3 months. Q2-Q4 are evolving roadmaps that we'll refine based on your progress."

**Review Q1 medical interventions**:

**Medications**:
- For each medication: "I'm prescribing [name, dose, frequency] to [purpose]. Our target is [specific lab value or outcome]. We'll recheck [when] to see if it's working and adjust if needed."
- Discuss side effects, cost, logistics.
- **Assess barriers**: "Is there anything that would make it hard for you to take this medication?" (cost, side effects fear, pill burden, etc.)

**Procedures/screenings**:
- For each: "We need to schedule [procedure] for [purpose]. This is [importance level - overdue, preventive, diagnostic]. Let's get this on the calendar."
- Discuss logistics, prep, what to expect.

**Supplements**:
- For each: "I recommend [supplement, dose] for [purpose]. This is [evidence level - treating deficiency, performance enhancement, etc.]."
- Discuss cost, where to buy, quality considerations.

**Review Q1 lifestyle prescription - GO SLOW HERE**:

**Movement**:
- "Here's your specific movement prescription: [strength training details, aerobic training details, daily movement target]."
- **Demonstrate if possible** (show air squat, show Zone 2 intensity check)
- **Assess barriers**: "What would make this easier or harder for you? Do you have access to a gym or equipment? Do you prefer exercising alone or with others?"
- **Adjust based on barriers**: If no gym access → body weight or resistance bands at home. If joint pain → low-impact options like swimming or cycling.

**Nutrition**:
- "Here's your nutrition prescription: [protein target, meal timing, fiber target, hydration]."
- **Make it practical**: "Protein target of 100g/day means about 25-30g per meal. That's a palm-sized portion of chicken, fish, or tofu, or a 2-egg omelet with Greek yogurt."
- **Assess barriers**: "What's hardest about nutrition for you right now? Meal prep time? Knowing what to eat? Budget?"
- **Adjust based on barriers**: If time-limited → batch cooking on weekends, simple meals. If budget-limited → eggs, beans, frozen vegetables (cheaper and just as nutritious).

**Sleep**:
- "Here's your sleep prescription: [sleep window, sleep hygiene practices]."
- **Emphasize consistency**: "The most important thing is going to bed and waking up at the same time every day, including weekends. Your body thrives on predictability."
- **Assess barriers**: "What makes it hard for you to get to bed by [bedtime]? Work schedule? Kids? Scrolling on phone?"
- **Adjust based on barriers**: If shift work → discuss light exposure strategies. If phone scrolling → recommend app blocker or charging phone outside bedroom.

**Mental health**:
- "Here's your stress management prescription: [specific technique, duration]."
- **Make it practical**: "Box breathing is 4 counts in, hold 4, out 4, hold 4. You can do this anywhere - in your car before work, in the bathroom during a stressful day."
- **Assess barriers**: "Do you have 10 minutes a day for this? What time of day would work best?"

**Surroundings**:
- "Here are environmental changes that will support your health: [light exposure, ergonomics, social connection]."
- **Make it practical**: "Morning light means stepping outside for 10 minutes with your coffee, or sitting by a window. It doesn't have to be direct sunlight."
- **Assess barriers**: "What's realistic for you?"

**Review Q2-Q4 roadmap (briefly - 2 minutes)**:
- "Here's the general direction we're heading over the next year: [quarterly themes]."
- "These will evolve based on how Q1 goes. We'll refine them together at each quarterly follow-up."

#### 7. Review Section 6: Monitoring & Follow-Up Plan (3 minutes)

**Show metrics we're tracking**:
- "Here are the specific things we're going to measure to know if this plan is working: [capacity, resilience, flexibility, risk markers]."
- "Your baseline is [baseline], and we're targeting [target] by [timeframe]."

**Explain follow-up schedule**:
- "Here's when we'll check in: [Week 2 phone call, Week 6 visit, Week 12 reassessment, etc.]."
- "Between visits, you can track [daily metrics] using [app or journal], and message me anytime if you have questions or run into problems."

#### 8. Address Barriers & Adjust Plan (5 minutes)

**Ask explicitly**:
- "Now that you've seen the whole plan, what feels doable? What feels overwhelming or unrealistic?"
- "What barriers do you anticipate?"

**Adjust plan based on feedback**:
- If overwhelmed → simplify Q1 plan (reduce priorities, start with smallest changes, build confidence)
- If specific barrier → problem-solve together (cost, time, access, family support, etc.)
- If patient wants to start with just 1-2 things → agree on keystone habits (sleep window + daily walk, for example) and add more in 2-4 weeks

**Validate effort**:
- "This is a lot. You don't have to be perfect. Progress, not perfection."
- "We're building habits that will last for years. It's okay if it takes time to get there."

#### 9. Obtain Agreement & Provide Care Plan Document (2 minutes)

**Review agreement**:
- "Do you agree to actively participate in this plan? That means doing your best to follow the prescriptions, tracking your metrics, and communicating with me if something isn't working."

**Patient signs care plan** (physical signature or electronic).

**Provide final copy**:
- Digital copy (email or patient portal)
- Printed copy (patient leaves with document in hand)

**Final encouragement**:
- "I'm excited to work on this with you. You have a clear roadmap now. Let's check in [Week 2] to see how the first couple weeks go."

## PHASE 5: QUARTERLY FOLLOW-UP & REFINEMENT

### Objective
Assess progress, troubleshoot barriers, refine evolving plan.

### Q1 Follow-Up (Week 12 / Month 3) - Comprehensive Reassessment (60 minutes)

#### 1. Review Q1 Adherence & Progress (15 minutes)

**Adherence check**:
- "Let's review your Q1 plan. What did you do consistently? What was hard to stick with?"
- For each intervention (medications, movement, nutrition, sleep, etc.): Rate adherence 0-10 scale
- **Celebrate wins**, even small ones

**Progress check - Capacity metrics**:
- Repeat functional tests (6MWT, sit-to-stand, grip strength)
- Review patient-reported outcomes (energy, sleep, pain, mood)
- Compare to baseline: "Your 6-minute walk went from 380m to 420m - that's a 10% improvement. How does that feel to you?"

**Progress check - Resilience metrics**:
- Review recovery patterns: "How quickly do you bounce back after a workout now compared to 3 months ago?"
- Review consistency: "Is your energy level more stable day-to-day?"

**Progress check - Risk markers**:
- Repeat labs (at minimum: lipids, A1c, metabolic panel, others as indicated)
- Review imaging if any new scans
- Compare to baseline and targets: "Your LDL dropped from 142 to 95 with the statin and lifestyle changes. We're targeting <70, so we're close."

#### 2. Update Health Matrix (10 minutes)

**Re-assess 24 cells** (may not need full physical exam, but reassess based on new data):
- Structure: Any new imaging showing structural changes?
- Function: Functional tests improved/stable/declined?
- Risk: Labs improved/stable/declined?

**Reassign traffic light status for each cell**.

**Compare to baseline matrix**: "Here's your Health Matrix from 3 months ago, and here's where you are now. Look at these changes: [highlight improvements]."

#### 3. Refine Q2 Plan Based on Q1 Response (20 minutes)

**If Q1 went well (good adherence, metrics improving)**:
- **Progress the plan**: Increase training volume/intensity, add complexity (interval training, heavier weights, longer fasting windows), address secondary systems if primary systems stabilized
- **Adjust medications**: Titrate up if not at target, titrate down or discontinue if target achieved and sustained (e.g., discontinue metformin if A1c normalized with lifestyle alone)

**If Q1 adherence was poor or metrics didn't improve**:
- **Troubleshoot barriers**: "What got in the way?" Problem-solve together.
- **Simplify the plan**: Reduce scope, focus on 1-2 keystone habits, build confidence with small wins
- **Adjust interventions**: If medication not working, try alternative. If exercise prescription too hard, reduce intensity/volume.

**If Q1 had mixed results** (some things improved, others didn't):
- **Celebrate what worked**, troubleshoot what didn't
- **Keep what's working**, adjust what's not

**Document Q2 plan** (now with same level of detail as Q1 originally had):
- Updated medical interventions (medication adjustments, new procedures/screenings)
- Updated lifestyle prescription (progression or modification based on Q1 response)
- New metrics/targets for Q2

#### 4. Preview Q3-Q4 Roadmap (5 minutes)

Briefly discuss general direction for Q3-Q4 (still evolving, will refine at Q2 follow-up).

#### 5. Schedule Q2 Follow-Up (Month 6)

#### 6. Provide Updated Care Plan Document

Patient leaves with updated care plan reflecting Q2 detail.

---

### Q2 Follow-Up (Month 6) - Comprehensive Reassessment (60 minutes)

**Same structure as Q1 follow-up**:
1. Review Q2 adherence & progress
2. Update Health Matrix
3. Refine Q3 plan based on Q2 response
4. Preview Q4 roadmap
5. Schedule Q3 follow-up
6. Provide updated care plan document

---

### Q3 Follow-Up (Month 9) - Check-In Visit (30 minutes, can be telehealth)

**Lighter touch** (no comprehensive reassessment unless indicated):
1. **Review Q3 adherence & progress** (10 minutes)
2. **Spot-check metrics** (10 minutes) - Patient-reported outcomes, any concerning symptoms, no need for full lab panel unless something changed
3. **Refine Q4 plan** (5 minutes) - Focus on sustaining gains, preparing for annual reassessment
4. **Preview next year** (5 minutes) - "You've made great progress this year. Let's start thinking about what you want to focus on next year."
5. **Schedule annual comprehensive reassessment** (Month 12)

---

### Q4 Follow-Up (Month 12) - Annual Comprehensive Reassessment (60 minutes)

**Same structure as initial comprehensive assessment**:
1. **Repeat comprehensive Health Matrix assessment** (history update, physical exam, labs, imaging as indicated, functional tests, patient-reported outcomes)
2. **Compare to baseline** (Month 0) - "Here's where you were a year ago, and here's where you are now. Look at this progress: [celebrate wins]."
3. **Reflect on year** (10 minutes):
   - "Did you achieve your original goal? If yes, celebrate. If no, why not - were there barriers we didn't anticipate?"
   - "What did you learn about yourself this year?"
   - "What worked well? What didn't?"
4. **Set next year's goals** (10 minutes):
   - "What do you want to focus on for the next year?"
   - Often patients set more ambitious goals after year 1 success (e.g., "maintain health" → "run a half marathon")
5. **Generate new 12-month care plan** using same methodology

## PHASE 6: ANNUAL COMPREHENSIVE REASSESSMENT

See Q4 Follow-Up above - this becomes the new baseline for Year 2.

## Clinical Pearls & Best Practices

### 1. Start With the Goal, Always

The patient's personal health goal is the center point. Every intervention should be explainable in terms of how it supports that goal. If you can't connect an intervention to the goal, either re-explain it or reconsider whether it's truly a priority.

### 2. Prioritize Ruthlessly

You cannot fix everything at once. Choose 2-3 priority systems for Q1. Build capacity and adherence there, then expand. Trying to address 6 systems simultaneously leads to overwhelm and poor adherence.

### 3. Lifestyle Prescription Must Be Specific

"Eat better and exercise more" doesn't work. Prescribe with specificity:
- Not "exercise more" → "Strength train 2x/week, 30-40 min, focusing on squats, push-ups, rows, using body weight or light dumbbells"
- Not "eat healthier" → "100g protein per day, distributed as 25-30g per meal; 12-hour eating window, 7am-7pm; 5 servings vegetables per day"

### 4. Use Quarterly Structure to Avoid Overwhelm

Patients can't execute a 50-item action plan. Break it into quarters with 2-3 priorities per quarter. Give them a detailed Q1 plan and evolving Q2-Q4 roadmap. Refine quarterly based on progress.

### 5. Track Performance, Not Just Risk

Traditional medicine tracks only risk markers (cholesterol, blood pressure, A1c). Performance Medicine also tracks capacity (what you can do today), resilience (how quickly you recover), and flexibility (how well you adapt). Patients care more about these performance metrics than lab values.

### 6. Celebrate Progress, Not Perfection

Patients will not adhere perfectly. Celebrate what they DID do, not what they didn't. Progress, not perfection. Build on wins.

### 7. Troubleshoot Barriers Proactively

If a patient isn't adhering, don't scold them - problem-solve. What got in the way? How can we adjust the plan to fit their real life? Barriers are data, not failure.

### 8. Use Technology, But Don't Depend On It

Apps, wearables, and AI tools can enhance care planning (tracking metrics, generating templates, etc.), but the human relationship is irreplaceable. Use tech to save time on administrative tasks so you can spend more time connecting with the patient.

### 9. Integrate Specialists, Don't Replace Them

Performance Medicine coordinates with specialists, not replaces them. Communicate with specialists, integrate their recommendations into the unified care plan, and ensure the patient feels they have one coordinated care team (not fragmented silos).

### 10. The Care Plan Document Is the Product

The written care plan document is what differentiates Performance Medicine from traditional care. Patients leave with a tangible roadmap. This is what they're paying for - clarity, comprehensiveness, and coordination. Make it high-quality, readable, and actionable.

## Summary: The Care Planning Methodology

**Phase 1: Pre-Visit Preparation**
- Patient completes comprehensive intake forms (demographics, history, lifestyle, goals)
- Provider reviews, identifies priorities, prepares assessment strategy

**Phase 2: Comprehensive Health Assessment**
- 60-90 minute visit: Goal conversation, focused history, full physical exam (8 systems), functional testing, order labs/imaging

**Phase 3: Data Analysis & Care Plan Generation**
- Assign Health Matrix status (8 systems × 3 domains = 24 cells)
- Identify 2-3 priority systems
- Map life stage clinical priorities
- Identify preventive care gaps
- Generate unified prescription (medical + lifestyle, 5 pillars)
- Structure into quarterly phases (detailed Q1, evolving Q2-Q4)
- Select monitoring metrics
- Populate care plan template

**Phase 4: Care Plan Review & Finalization**
- 30-45 minute visit: Review care plan section by section, address questions, adjust based on barriers, obtain patient agreement, provide document

**Phase 5: Quarterly Follow-Up & Refinement**
- Q1 (Month 3): Comprehensive reassessment, update Health Matrix, refine Q2 plan
- Q2 (Month 6): Comprehensive reassessment, update Health Matrix, refine Q3 plan
- Q3 (Month 9): Check-in visit (brief), refine Q4 plan
- Q4 (Month 12): Annual comprehensive reassessment, celebrate progress, set next year's goals

**Phase 6: Annual Comprehensive Reassessment**
- Full Health Matrix re-evaluation, compare to baseline, generate new 12-month care plan
