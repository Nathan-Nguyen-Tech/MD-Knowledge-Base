# Acute Care Management Protocols

## Overview

This document provides **clinical protocols for managing acute medical issues** within the Performance Medicine framework. These protocols complement the comprehensive chronic care and performance optimization care plans by addressing urgent and acute problems that arise between scheduled visits.

**Scope**: Common acute presentations that can be managed in an outpatient Performance Medicine practice (assuming AI-based triage has already determined outpatient management is appropriate).

**Note**: This document does NOT include triage protocols (AI agent handles triage). These are **treatment and management protocols** for conditions already triaged as appropriate for outpatient care.

---

## Protocol Structure

Each acute care protocol includes:
1. **Clinical Presentation** - Common symptoms and signs
2. **Assessment** - History questions, focused exam, point-of-care testing
3. **Treatment Protocol** - Medications, supportive care, non-pharmacologic interventions
4. **Follow-Up Plan** - When to recheck, red flags, when to escalate
5. **Integration with Comprehensive Care Plan** - How acute issue affects quarterly plan

## SECTION 1: RESPIRATORY ACUTE CARE

---

### 1.1 Acute Upper Respiratory Infection (URI / Common Cold)

**Clinical Presentation**: Nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, sore throat, cough, low-grade fever, malaise

**Assessment**:
- **History**: Duration of symptoms, fever pattern, sputum color, sick contacts, baseline respiratory status
- **Exam**: Vital signs (fever, O2 sat), nasal exam, throat exam (tonsillar exudate?), lung auscultation (clear vs. rales/rhonchi)
- **Differentiation**:
  - Viral URI: Clear/white nasal discharge, no high fever, gradual onset
  - Bacterial sinusitis: Purulent nasal discharge, facial pain, symptoms >10 days or worsening after initial improvement
  - Strep pharyngitis: Severe sore throat, tonsillar exudate, fever, no cough (Centor criteria)
  - COVID-19: Loss of taste/smell, dry cough, high fever (test if indicated)

**Treatment Protocol**:

**Supportive Care** (all patients):
- Rest, hydration (2-3L water/day)
- Humidified air (humidifier or steam)
- Saline nasal irrigation (neti pot, nasal spray) 3-4x/day
- Honey for cough (1 tbsp as needed, not for children <1 year)
- Throat lozenges, warm salt water gargles for sore throat

**Symptomatic Medications** (as needed):
- **Decongestant**: Pseudoephedrine 30-60mg PO q4-6h PRN (max 240mg/day) OR phenylephrine nasal spray (limit to 3 days to avoid rebound)
  - Caution: Avoid pseudoephedrine if hypertension, heart disease, or insomnia
- **Cough suppressant**: Dextromethorphan 10-20mg PO q4h PRN (if dry, non-productive cough)
- **Expectorant**: Guaifenesin 200-400mg PO q4h PRN (if productive cough with thick mucus)
- **Pain/fever**: Acetaminophen 500-1000mg PO q6h PRN OR ibuprofen 400-600mg PO q6h PRN
- **Antihistamine** (if significant rhinorrhea): Diphenhydramine 25-50mg PO q6h PRN (sedating) OR loratadine 10mg PO daily (non-sedating)

**Antibiotics** (only if bacterial infection suspected):
- **Strep pharyngitis** (positive rapid strep or high suspicion): Amoxicillin 500mg PO BID × 10 days (or penicillin VK 500mg PO QID × 10 days)
- **Bacterial sinusitis** (purulent discharge + facial pain + >10 days OR worsening after initial improvement): Amoxicillin-clavulanate 875mg PO BID × 10 days

**Follow-Up Plan**:
- **Self-care timeframe**: Most viral URIs resolve in 7-10 days
- **Recheck if**: Symptoms worsen after 3-4 days, no improvement after 10 days, high fever >3 days, severe headache, facial swelling, shortness of breath
- **Red flags** (escalate to urgent visit or ED): Difficulty breathing, stridor, inability to swallow secretions, severe headache with neck stiffness, altered mental status

**Integration with Care Plan**:
- **Modify exercise**: Reduce intensity (50% usual) or rest if fever present; resume gradually after symptoms resolve
- **Maintain sleep**: May need extra sleep during acute illness
- **Hydration**: Emphasize increased fluid intake
- **Nutrition**: Soft, easy-to-swallow foods if sore throat; maintain protein intake to support immune recovery

---

### 1.2 Acute Bronchitis

**Clinical Presentation**: Persistent cough (productive or dry), chest discomfort, no pneumonia on exam, may follow URI

**Assessment**:
- **History**: Cough duration and character (productive vs. dry), sputum color, fever, shortness of breath, wheezing, smoking history, baseline lung disease (asthma, COPD)
- **Exam**: Vital signs (O2 sat critical), lung auscultation (wheezing? rales? bronchial breath sounds?), work of breathing
- **Point-of-care testing**: Pulse oximetry (normal >95% on room air)
- **Differentiation**:
  - Acute bronchitis: Normal O2 sat, no focal findings on lung exam, cough may be productive
  - Pneumonia: Fever, focal rales/crackles, tachypnea, hypoxia → needs chest X-ray and possible antibiotics
  - Asthma exacerbation: Wheezing, shortness of breath, known asthma history → needs bronchodilators

**Treatment Protocol**:

**Supportive Care**:
- Rest, hydration
- Humidified air
- Honey for cough (1 tbsp PRN)
- Chest physiotherapy (percussion, postural drainage if very productive cough)

**Symptomatic Medications**:
- **Cough suppressant** (if dry, non-productive cough): Dextromethorphan 10-20mg PO q4h PRN
- **Expectorant** (if thick, productive cough): Guaifenesin 200-400mg PO q4h PRN
- **Bronchodilator** (if wheezing or known reactive airway): Albuterol inhaler 2 puffs q4-6h PRN
- **Anti-inflammatory** (if significant cough/inflammation): Ibuprofen 400-600mg PO q6h PRN

**Antibiotics**: NOT routinely indicated for acute bronchitis (mostly viral)
- **Consider antibiotics if**: COPD exacerbation (increased dyspnea + purulent sputum + increased sputum volume), high suspicion of pertussis (prolonged cough >3 weeks with paroxysms)

**Follow-Up Plan**:
- **Self-care timeframe**: Cough may persist 2-3 weeks after acute illness
- **Recheck if**: Worsening dyspnea, fever >3 days, O2 sat <94%, cough >3 weeks, hemoptysis (blood in sputum)
- **Red flags**: Respiratory distress, hypoxia, severe chest pain, altered mental status

**Integration with Care Plan**:
- **Modify exercise**: Rest or very light activity until cough and dyspnea improve; avoid cardio training until O2 sat normal and symptoms resolving
- **Monitor respiratory function**: If patient has COPD or asthma, reassess Function domain of Respiratory system after recovery
- **Smoking cessation** (if applicable): Acute bronchitis is opportunity to reinforce smoking cessation counseling

---

### 1.3 Asthma Exacerbation (Mild-Moderate)

**Clinical Presentation**: Increased wheezing, shortness of breath, chest tightness, cough, decreased peak flow (if patient monitors)

**Assessment**:
- **History**: Asthma triggers (infection, allergen, cold air, exercise), current controller medications and adherence, rescue inhaler use (how many puffs today?), previous exacerbations/hospitalizations
- **Exam**: Vital signs (respiratory rate, O2 sat, heart rate), lung auscultation (wheezing, prolonged expiration, decreased air movement), work of breathing (accessory muscle use, tripod positioning)
- **Peak flow** (if available): Compare to patient's personal best or predicted

**Treatment Protocol**:

**Immediate Bronchodilator Therapy**:
- **Albuterol inhaler**: 4-8 puffs (using spacer) q20 minutes × 3 doses, then reassess
- OR **Albuterol nebulizer**: 2.5-5mg nebulized q20 minutes × 3 doses, then reassess

**Systemic Corticosteroids** (if moderate exacerbation):
- **Prednisone 40-60mg PO daily × 5 days** (no taper needed for 5-day course)
- Indication: Inadequate response to bronchodilators, recent exacerbation, severe symptoms

**Continuation Therapy**:
- **Albuterol inhaler**: 2 puffs q4-6h PRN (as needed for next 7-10 days)
- **Increase controller inhaler** (if on inhaled corticosteroid): Double dose temporarily, then reassess with PCP

**Follow-Up Plan**:
- **Recheck in 3-5 days**: Assess response to treatment, review inhaler technique, optimize controller medication
- **Red flags** (go to ED): No improvement after 3 albuterol treatments, O2 sat <90%, unable to speak full sentences, confusion, cyanosis

**Integration with Care Plan**:
- **Review Asthma Action Plan**: Ensure patient has written plan with green/yellow/red zones
- **Identify and address trigger**: Was this exercise-induced (need pre-treatment protocol)? Allergen exposure (need environmental modifications)? Medication non-adherence (need adherence support)?
- **Modify exercise**: No cardio training during exacerbation; can resume gradually once symptoms controlled and peak flow >80% personal best
- **Reassess Respiratory System Function domain**: If frequent exacerbations, escalate to orange/red priority

---

### 1.4 COPD Exacerbation

**Clinical Presentation**: Increased dyspnea, increased sputum volume, increased sputum purulence (Anthonisen criteria)

**Assessment**:
- **History**: Baseline dyspnea/sputum production, change in symptoms (dyspnea worse? sputum more? sputum color change?), trigger (infection vs. other), current medications and adherence, previous exacerbations/hospitalizations, home oxygen use
- **Exam**: Vital signs (respiratory rate, O2 sat - compare to baseline, heart rate), lung auscultation (wheezing, rhonchi, decreased breath sounds), work of breathing, peripheral edema (RHF?)
- **Point-of-care testing**: Pulse oximetry (note: COPD patients may have baseline low O2 sat - know their baseline)

**Treatment Protocol**:

**Bronchodilator Therapy**:
- **Albuterol + Ipratropium nebulizer** (DuoNeb): 3mL nebulized q4-6h × 48 hours, then PRN
- OR **Albuterol inhaler**: 4-8 puffs q4-6h PRN

**Systemic Corticosteroids**:
- **Prednisone 40mg PO daily × 5 days** (evidence supports 5-day course for most exacerbations)

**Antibiotics** (if purulent sputum OR severe exacerbation):
- **Azithromycin 500mg PO × 1 dose, then 250mg PO daily × 4 more days** (total 5 days)
- OR **Doxycycline 100mg PO BID × 5-7 days**
- OR **Amoxicillin-clavulanate 875mg PO BID × 5-7 days** (if recent antibiotic use or severe)

**Oxygen** (if hypoxic):
- Titrate to O2 sat 88-92% (NOT higher - avoid oxygen toxicity in COPD)
- Arrange home oxygen if not already using

**Follow-Up Plan**:
- **Recheck in 48-72 hours**: Assess response, ensure O2 sat stable, review inhaler technique
- **Red flags** (go to ED): O2 sat <88% despite supplemental oxygen, altered mental status, inability to care for self, no improvement after 48 hours of treatment

**Integration with Care Plan**:
- **Identify and address trigger**: Medication non-adherence? Need long-acting bronchodilators? Need pulmonary rehab referral?
- **Smoking cessation** (if still smoking): Exacerbation is critical teachable moment
- **Modify exercise**: Rest during exacerbation; after recovery, pulmonary rehab or low-intensity walking as tolerated
- **Reassess Respiratory System Risk domain**: Frequent exacerbations → higher risk, may need escalation of therapy or specialist referral

## SECTION 2: GASTROINTESTINAL ACUTE CARE

---

### 2.1 Acute Gastroenteritis (Viral)

**Clinical Presentation**: Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea (watery, non-bloody), abdominal cramping, low-grade fever, no severe systemic symptoms

**Assessment**:
- **History**: Onset and duration, frequency of vomiting/diarrhea, blood in stool (red flag), fever, sick contacts, recent travel, food exposure, ability to tolerate oral fluids, signs of dehydration (dizziness, decreased urination)
- **Exam**: Vital signs (orthostatic hypotension?), abdominal exam (diffuse tenderness OK, peritoneal signs = concern), hydration status (mucous membranes, skin turgor, capillary refill)

**Treatment Protocol**:

**Oral Rehydration**:
- **Goal**: Prevent dehydration
- **Fluids**: Oral rehydration solution (Pedialyte, Gatorade) or diluted juice/broth
- **Strategy**: Small sips frequently (2-3 oz every 15 minutes) rather than large volumes at once
- **Target**: Clear or light-colored urine, no dizziness, moist mucous membranes

**Dietary Management**:
- **During acute phase** (nausea/vomiting): Clear liquids only (broth, herbal tea, Pedialyte)
- **As symptoms improve**: BRAT diet (bananas, rice, applesauce, toast) or bland, low-fat foods
- **Avoid**: Dairy (temporary lactose intolerance common), fatty/spicy foods, alcohol, caffeine

**Symptomatic Medications**:

- **Anti-diarrheal**:
  - Loperamide (Imodium) 4mg PO × 1, then 2mg after each loose stool (max 16mg/day)
  - **Do NOT use if**: Bloody diarrhea, high fever, severe abdominal pain (concern for bacterial infection - antidiarrheals can worsen)

**Probiotics**:
- Consider probiotic supplement (Lactobacillus, Saccharomyces boulardii) to shorten duration

**Follow-Up Plan**:
- **Self-care timeframe**: Most viral gastroenteritis resolves in 24-72 hours

- **Eat smaller, frequent meals** (5-6 small meals vs. 3 large)
- **Don't lie down within 3 hours of eating**
- **Stress management**: If stress is trigger, reinforce stress reduction techniques

**H. pylori Testing** (if recurrent or not improving):
- Consider H. pylori stool antigen or urea breath test
- If positive → triple therapy (PPI + amoxicillin + clarithromycin × 14 days)

**Follow-Up Plan**:
- **Recheck in 2-4 weeks**: Assess response to PPI, consider endoscopy if no improvement or alarm symptoms
- **Red flags**: Black/tarry stools (melena), vomiting blood (hematemesis), severe pain, unintentional weight loss → urgent GI referral or ED

**Integration with Care Plan**:
- **Nutrition modifications**: Temporarily avoid trigger foods; may need meal timing adjustments
- **Stress management**: If stress-induced gastritis, escalate Mental Health pillar interventions
- **Medication review**: If NSAID-induced, find alternatives for musculoskeletal pain (acetaminophen, topical NSAIDs, PT)

---

### 2.3 Acute Constipation

## SECTION 4: MUSCULOSKELETAL ACUTE CARE

---

### 4.1 Acute Low Back Pain (Non-Specific)

**Clinical Presentation**: Sudden-onset low back pain, may radiate to buttocks, worse with movement, relieved with rest

**Assessment**:
- **History**: Onset (lifting injury? gradual?), location and radiation, red flags (bowel/bladder dysfunction, saddle anesthesia, progressive weakness, fever, trauma, cancer history, age >50 with new-onset pain), previous episodes, response to past treatments
- **Exam**: Inspect gait, range of motion, palpate paraspinal muscles (spasm?), straight leg raise (if positive → radiculopathy concern), neurological exam (strength, sensation, reflexes in lower extremities), check for cauda equina signs (saddle anesthesia, post-void residual)
- **Imaging**: NOT routinely indicated for acute non-specific low back pain <4-6 weeks UNLESS red flags present

**Treatment Protocol**:

**Non-Pharmacologic (First-Line)**:

  - OR Methocarbamol 500-750mg PO QID PRN
  - Limit to short-term use (5-7 days)
- **Acetaminophen**: 500-1000mg PO q6h PRN (if NSAIDs contraindicated)

**Avoid**:
- Opioids (NOT recommended for acute non-specific low back pain - risks outweigh benefits)

**Follow-Up Plan**:
- **Most acute low back pain improves within 4-6 weeks**
- **Recheck if**: No improvement after 4-6 weeks, worsening pain, neurological symptoms develop (weakness, numbness, bowel/bladder changes)
- **Red flags** (urgent evaluation): Cauda equina syndrome (saddle anesthesia, bowel/bladder dysfunction, bilateral leg weakness), progressive neurological deficit, fever with back pain, trauma

**Integration with Care Plan**:
- **Modify exercise**: No heavy lifting, no spinal flexion/twisting exercises; can do walking, gentle stretching; progress to core strengthening once acute pain resolves
- **Core strengthening**: After acute phase, incorporate into Movement prescription (dead bugs, planks, bird dogs)

- **Grade I** (mild): Stretch of ligament, minimal swelling, can weight-bear, no instability
- **Grade II** (moderate): Partial tear, moderate swelling/ecchymosis, difficulty weight-bearing, mild instability
- **Grade III** (severe): Complete tear, severe swelling/ecchymosis, cannot weight-bear, significant instability

**Treatment Protocol**:

**Acute Phase (First 48-72 hours) - RICE Protocol**:
- **Rest**: Avoid weight-bearing on injured ankle (crutches if needed)
- **Ice**: 20 minutes every 2-3 hours (ice pack, ice massage)
- **Compression**: Elastic bandage or ankle brace (not too tight - check for circulation)
- **Elevation**: Elevate above heart level as much as possible

**Pharmacologic**:
- **NSAIDs**: Ibuprofen 400-600mg PO TID × 5-7 days (reduces pain and inflammation)

**Immobilization**:
- **Grade I**: Elastic bandage or ankle sleeve
- **Grade II**: Lace-up ankle brace or air cast boot
- **Grade III**: Walking boot or short leg cast × 2-3 weeks (refer to orthopedics if severe instability)

**Rehabilitation Phase (After 72 hours)**:
- **Range of motion exercises**: Ankle circles, alphabet tracing (day 3-5)
- **Strengthening exercises**: Resistance band exercises (dorsiflexion, plantarflexion, inversion, eversion) - start week 2
- **Balance training**: Single-leg stance (start week 3-4) - critical to prevent re-injury

- **Physical therapy referral** if Grade II-III or slow recovery

**Follow-Up Plan**:
- **Grade I**: Self-care, return to activity in 1-2 weeks
- **Grade II**: Recheck in 1 week, PT referral, return to activity in 3-6 weeks
- **Grade III**: Recheck in 1 week, orthopedics referral if severe, return to activity in 6-12 weeks
- **Red flags**: Severe pain out of proportion, compartment syndrome signs (severe pain with passive stretch, pallor, paresthesias), fracture on X-ray

**Integration with Care Plan**:
- **Modify exercise**: No lower body impact training until healed; can do upper body strength training, swimming (once can kick comfortably)
- **Balance training**: Incorporate into Movement prescription long-term to prevent re-injury (single-leg balance exercises)
- **Proper footwear**: Ensure supportive shoes for training (Surroundings pillar)

### 4.3 Acute Muscle Strain

**Clinical Presentation**: Sudden pain during activity (lifting, sprinting), localized tenderness, swelling, limited range of motion

**Assessment**:
- **History**: Mechanism (eccentric contraction during lifting/sprinting?), location (hamstring, quadriceps, calf, back), immediate vs. delayed pain, ability to continue activity
- **Exam**: Inspect (swelling, ecchymosis), palpate (focal tenderness, palpable defect if severe tear), strength testing (pain/weakness with contraction), range of motion (limited by pain)

**Grading**:
- **Grade I** (mild): Overstretching, minimal fiber disruption, mild pain, <10% strength loss
- **Grade II** (moderate): Partial tear, moderate pain, swelling, 10-50% strength loss
- **Grade III** (severe): Complete tear, severe pain, palpable defect, >50% strength loss → refer to sports medicine or orthopedics

**Treatment Protocol**:

**Acute Phase (First 48-72 hours) - RICE Protocol**:
- **Rest**: Avoid painful activity (but not complete immobilization)
- **Ice**: 20 minutes every 2-3 hours for first 48 hours
- **Compression**: Elastic bandage
- **Elevation**: Elevate if possible

**Pharmacologic**:
- **NSAIDs**: Ibuprofen 400-600mg PO TID × 5-7 days
  - Note: Some evidence that NSAIDs may impair muscle healing long-term; use short-term only for pain/inflammation control

**Rehabilitation Phase (After 72 hours)**:
- **Gentle stretching**: Start day 3-5, hold 20-30 seconds, no pain
- **Progressive strengthening**:
  - Week 1-2: Isometric exercises (muscle contraction without movement)
  - Week 2-3: Isotonic exercises (light resistance, full range of motion)
  - Week 3-4: Eccentric exercises (lowering phase of movement - critical for preventing re-injury)
  - Week 4+: Sport-specific training
- **Heat therapy** (after 72 hours): Can use heat before stretching/exercise to relax muscle
- **Massage** (gentle, after acute phase): May help with recovery

**Follow-Up Plan**:
- **Grade I**: Self-care, return to activity in 1-2 weeks with gradual progression
- **Grade II**: Recheck in 1-2 weeks, PT referral if slow recovery, return to activity in 3-6 weeks
- **Grade III**: Refer to sports medicine or orthopedics immediately (may need MRI, possible surgery)
- **Red flags**: Palpable defect (complete tear), severe weakness, inability to bear weight (if lower extremity)

**Integration with Care Plan**:
- **Modify training**: Follow 10% rule for progression - increase volume by no more than 10% per week
- **Warm-up protocol**: Ensure proper warm-up before training (5-10 min light cardio + dynamic stretching)
- **Eccentric training**: Incorporate eccentric exercises into Movement prescription to prevent re-injury (e.g., Nordic hamstring curls for hamstring strains)
- **Reassess if recurrent**: If recurrent muscle strains, evaluate for overtraining (inadequate recovery), nutritional deficiencies (protein, vitamin D), or biomechanical issues

### 5.1 Acute Headache (Primary - Tension, Migraine)

**Clinical Presentation**:
- **Tension headache**: Bilateral, band-like pressure, mild-moderate intensity, not worsened by activity
- **Migraine**: Unilateral (often), throbbing, moderate-severe intensity, worsened by activity, associated symptoms (nausea, photophobia, phonophobia, aura)

**Assessment**:
- **History**: Onset (sudden vs. gradual), location, quality, severity (0-10), duration, triggers, associated symptoms, previous similar headaches, red flags (thunderclap onset, fever, neck stiffness, neurological symptoms, age >50 with new headache, trauma)
- **Exam**: Vital signs (fever? hypertension?), neurological exam (mental status, cranial nerves, strength, sensation, reflexes, gait), neck stiffness (meningismus?), fundoscopic exam if available (papilledema?)
- **Red flags requiring urgent evaluation**: Thunderclap headache (sudden, worst headache of life), fever + headache + neck stiffness (meningitis), focal neurological deficits, altered mental status, age >50 with new headache, headache after head trauma

**Treatment Protocol**:

**Tension Headache**:
- **NSAIDs**: Ibuprofen 400-600mg PO q6h PRN OR naproxen 500mg PO BID PRN
- **Acetaminophen**: 500-1000mg PO q6h PRN (if NSAIDs contraindicated)
- **Non-pharmacologic**: Rest in quiet, dark room, neck stretches, heat to neck/shoulders, hydration, stress reduction

**Migraine**:

**Mild-Moderate Migraine**:
- **NSAIDs**: Ibuprofen 600-800mg PO at onset OR naproxen 500-550mg PO at onset
- **Acetaminophen**: 1000mg PO at onset
- **Caffeine**: Can enhance analgesic effect (caffeinated beverage or Excedrin Migraine)

**Moderate-Severe Migraine**:
- **Triptan** (first-line for moderate-severe):
  - Sumatriptan 50-100mg PO at onset (may repeat once after 2 hours if partial response; max 200mg/day)
  - OR Rizatriptan 10mg PO at onset (may repeat once after 2 hours)
  - Contraindications: Uncontrolled hypertension, coronary artery disease, prior stroke
- **Anti-nausea**: Metoclopramide 10mg PO or ondansetron 4-8mg PO (if nausea prominent)

**Migraine Abortive "Cocktail"** (for severe migraine):
- Sumatriptan 100mg PO + Naproxen 500mg PO + Metoclopramide 10mg PO (all at onset)

**Non-pharmacologic**:
- Rest in quiet, dark room (avoid light and sound)
- Cold compress to forehead or neck
- Hydration

**Preventive Therapy** (if frequent migraines - ≥4 per month):
- Refer for preventive medication initiation (beta-blockers, antiepileptics, CGRP inhibitors)

**Follow-Up Plan**:
- **Tension headache**: Self-care, recheck if persistent or worsening
- **Migraine**: Recheck if not improving with treatment, headache >72 hours, or frequent migraines (need preventive therapy)
- **Red flags**: New neurological symptoms, worst headache of life, fever, altered mental status → urgent evaluation

**Integration with Care Plan**:
- **Identify triggers**: Track headache diary (food, sleep, stress, hormonal changes)
- **Sleep consistency**: Irregular sleep is common migraine trigger (reinforce Sleep pillar)
- **Stress management**: Tension headaches and migraines often stress-triggered (Mental Health pillar)
- **Hydration**: Dehydration is common trigger (Nutrition pillar)
- **Medication overuse headache**: If using abortive medications >10 days/month, risk of rebound headache - need preventive therapy

---

### 5.2 Acute Vertigo (Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo - BPPV)

**Clinical Presentation**: Brief episodes of spinning sensation triggered by head position changes (rolling over in bed, looking up, bending over), no hearing loss or tinnitus

**Assessment**:
- **History**: Onset, triggers (position changes?), duration of episodes (seconds to minutes = BPPV; hours = Meniere's; days = vestibular neuritis), associated symptoms (hearing loss, tinnitus, neurological symptoms)
- **Exam**: Vital signs, neurological exam (rule out central causes), **Dix-Hallpike maneuver** (diagnostic for BPPV - triggers vertigo and nystagmus)
- **Differentiation**:
  - BPPV: Brief episodes (<1 minute), triggered by position changes, positive Dix-Hallpike, no hearing loss
  - Vestibular neuritis: Sudden, severe, constant vertigo lasting hours-days, no hearing loss
  - Meniere's disease: Episodes lasting hours, hearing loss, tinnitus, ear fullness
  - Central vertigo (stroke, MS): Neurological symptoms (diplopia, dysarthria, ataxia, weakness) → urgent evaluation

**Treatment Protocol**:

**Canalith Repositioning Maneuver (Epley Maneuver)**:
- **First-line treatment for BPPV** - physically repositions displaced otoliths
- Can be performed in office (ideally by trained provider or PT)
- Success rate 80-90% with single treatment
- Patient may need to repeat at home or return for additional treatments

**Symptomatic Medications** (if needed, but repositioning is primary treatment):
- **Anti-vertigo**: Meclizine 25mg PO TID PRN (sedating, use short-term only - delays compensation if used long-term)
- **Anti-nausea**: Ondansetron 4-8mg PO q8h PRN (if nausea severe)

**Vestibular Rehabilitation Therapy (VRT)**:
- Refer to PT specializing in vestibular therapy if:
  - BPPV doesn't resolve with Epley maneuver
  - Persistent dizziness after BPPV resolves
  - Chronic imbalance

**Follow-Up Plan**:
- **Most BPPV resolves with 1-3 Epley maneuvers**
- **Recheck if**: No improvement after 2-3 treatments, symptoms worsen, neurological symptoms develop
- **Red flags**: Sudden severe headache with vertigo, neurological symptoms (weakness, vision changes, speech changes, severe ataxia) → concern for stroke, needs urgent evaluation

**Integration with Care Plan**:
- **Fall prevention**: BPPV increases fall risk (especially in older adults) - address in Surroundings pillar (home safety, assistive devices if needed)
- **Balance training**: After BPPV resolves, incorporate balance exercises into Movement prescription (single-leg stand, tandem walk) to improve vestibular compensation

## SECTION 6: CARDIOVASCULAR ACUTE CARE

---

### 6.1 Hypertensive Urgency (Asymptomatic Elevated BP)

**Clinical Presentation**: Blood pressure >180/120 mmHg WITHOUT end-organ damage symptoms (no chest pain, no headache, no vision changes, no dyspnea, no altered mental status)

**Assessment**:
- **History**: Current BP medications and adherence, recent medication changes, triggers (pain, anxiety, medication non-adherence, substance use), symptoms (chest pain, headache, vision changes, dyspnea → if present, this is hypertensive emergency, not urgency)
- **Exam**: Vital signs (recheck BP in both arms, orthostatic vitals), cardiovascular exam, neurological exam, fundoscopic exam (papilledema?), assess for end-organ damage
- **Differentiation**:
  - **Hypertensive urgency**: Asymptomatic elevated BP, no end-organ damage → outpatient management
  - **Hypertensive emergency**: Symptomatic elevated BP WITH end-organ damage (stroke, MI, pulmonary edema, acute kidney injury, encephalopathy) → immediate ED referral

**Treatment Protocol**:

**Goal**: Gradual BP reduction over 24-48 hours (NOT immediate reduction - risk of stroke if BP drops too fast)

**Outpatient Management**:

**If patient already on BP medications**:
- Assess adherence: "When did you last take your BP medication?"
- If missed doses → have patient take usual dose now, resume regular schedule
- If adherent → increase dose or add second agent

**Medication Adjustments**:
- **Add or increase ACE-inhibitor/ARB**:
  - Lisinopril 10mg PO daily (if not on ACE-I) OR increase current dose
  - OR Losartan 50mg PO daily (if ACE-I intolerant)
- **Add or increase diuretic**:
  - Hydrochlorothiazide 25mg PO daily OR Chlorthalidone 12.5-25mg PO daily
- **Add calcium channel blocker**:
  - Amlodipine 5mg PO daily

**Non-Pharmacologic**:
- Rest, reduce stress, avoid stimulants (caffeine)
- Low-sodium diet (<2000mg/day)

**Follow-Up Plan**:
- **Recheck BP in 24-48 hours**: In-person visit or home BP monitoring with phone call
- **Goal**: BP <140/90 within 48 hours (gradual reduction)
- **Red flags** (send to ED immediately): Chest pain, severe headache, vision changes, dyspnea, altered mental status, focal neurological symptoms → hypertensive emergency

**Integration with Care Plan**:
- **Medication adherence**: If non-adherence is issue, troubleshoot barriers (cost, side effects, pill burden, understanding of importance)
- **Lifestyle modifications**: Reinforce DASH diet (low sodium, high potassium), weight loss if obese, exercise, stress management, alcohol reduction
- **Home BP monitoring**: Provide home BP cuff, teach proper technique, track daily AM and PM BP
- **Reassess Cardiovascular Risk domain**: Hypertensive urgency indicates inadequate control → escalate to orange/red priority

## SECTION 7: MENTAL HEALTH ACUTE CARE

---

### 7.1 Acute Anxiety / Panic Attack

**Clinical Presentation**: Sudden onset of intense fear/discomfort with physical symptoms: palpitations, sweating, trembling, shortness of breath, chest pain, nausea, dizziness, paresthesias, derealization

**Assessment**:
- **History**: Onset (sudden vs. gradual), triggers, previous panic attacks, psychiatric history, substance use, cardiac history (need to rule out cardiac causes if first episode)
- **Exam**: Vital signs (tachycardia, tachypnea, hypertension common during panic attack), cardiovascular exam, respiratory exam, mental status exam
- **Rule out medical causes** (if first episode or atypical features):
  - Cardiac: MI, arrhythmia (ECG if chest pain, risk factors)
  - Endocrine: Hyperthyroidism (check TSH), hypoglycemia (check glucose)
  - Respiratory: Asthma, PE (if dyspnea prominent)
  - Substance: Caffeine, stimulants, drug withdrawal

**Treatment Protocol**:

**Acute Management (During Panic Attack)**:

**Non-Pharmacologic** (first-line):
- **Reassurance**: "You're having a panic attack. It feels terrible, but it's not dangerous. It will pass in 10-20 minutes."
- **Breathing technique**:
  - Box breathing: Inhale 4 counts, hold 4 counts, exhale 4 counts, hold 4 counts (repeat × 5 minutes)
  - Or slow, deep belly breathing (not hyperventilation)
- **Grounding technique**: 5-4-3-2-1 technique (name 5 things you see, 4 you hear, 3 you can touch, 2 you smell, 1 you taste)
- **Remove from triggering environment** if possible

**Pharmacologic** (if severe, not improving with above):
- **Benzodiazepine** (use cautiously, short-term only):
  - Lorazepam 0.5-1mg PO or SL (sublingual) × 1 dose
  - OR Alprazolam 0.25-0.5mg PO × 1 dose
  - Caution: Addictive, sedating, avoid if substance use history

**Long-Term Management** (if recurrent panic attacks):

**Medications**:
- **SSRI** (first-line for panic disorder):
  - Sertraline 25mg PO daily (start low, increase to 50-100mg over 2-4 weeks)
  - OR Escitalopram 5-10mg PO daily
  - Note: May take 4-6 weeks for full effect; may increase anxiety transiently in first 1-2 weeks
- **Avoid chronic benzodiazepines** (high addiction risk, cognitive impairment)

**Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)**:
- Refer to therapist specializing in CBT for panic disorder
- CBT as effective as medication, no side effects, lasting benefit

**Follow-Up Plan**:
- **Recheck in 1-2 weeks**: Assess response to SSRI (if started), side effects, frequency of panic attacks
- **Recheck in 4-6 weeks**: Assess full therapeutic response
- **Red flags**: Suicidal ideation, severe functional impairment, substance use to cope → urgent mental health referral

**Integration with Care Plan**:
- **Identify triggers**: Caffeine, poor sleep, high stress, exercise-induced (rare)?
- **Sleep**: Ensure consistent sleep (Sleep pillar) - sleep deprivation worsens anxiety
- **Stress management**: Incorporate daily breathwork/meditation into Mental Health pillar (10-15 min daily)
- **Exercise**: Regular aerobic exercise reduces anxiety (Movement pillar) - but avoid overtraining
- **Caffeine/stimulants**: Reduce or eliminate if anxiety is severe

## SECTION 8: DERMATOLOGIC ACUTE CARE

---

### 8.1 Acute Contact Dermatitis

**Clinical Presentation**: Itchy, red rash in area of contact with allergen/irritant, may have vesicles/bullae, well-demarcated borders

**Assessment**:
- **History**: Onset, location (clue to cause: hands = soaps/detergents; face = cosmetics; body = clothing/jewelry), new exposures (plants, chemicals, jewelry, cosmetics), previous similar episodes
- **Exam**: Inspect rash (erythema, edema, vesicles, distribution), assess severity (mild, moderate, severe)
- **Common causes**: Poison ivy/oak/sumac (urushiol oil), nickel (jewelry), latex, fragrances, preservatives

**Treatment Protocol**:

**Remove Offending Agent**:
- Identify and avoid allergen/irritant
- Wash skin with soap and water to remove residual allergen (do immediately after exposure if possible)

**Topical Corticosteroids** (first-line):
- **Mild dermatitis** (limited area, mild itch):
  - Hydrocortisone 1% cream BID × 7-14 days (over-the-counter)
- **Moderate dermatitis** (larger area, moderate itch):
  - Triamcinolone 0.1% cream BID × 7-14 days
  - OR Betamethasone 0.1% cream BID × 7-14 days
- **Severe dermatitis** (large area, severe itch, face involvement):
  - Clobetasol 0.05% cream BID × 7-10 days (potent - use short-term only)
  - OR Systemic corticosteroids (see below)

**Systemic Corticosteroids** (if severe, large area, or face involvement):
- **Prednisone 60mg PO daily × 5 days, then taper**: 40mg × 3 days, then 20mg × 3 days, then 10mg × 3 days (total 14-day course)
  - Tapering prevents rebound flare

**Antihistamines** (for itch):
- **Diphenhydramine 25-50mg PO q6h PRN** (sedating - good for nighttime)
- OR **Loratadine 10mg PO daily** OR **Cetirizine 10mg PO daily** (non-sedating - good for daytime)

**Non-Pharmacologic**:
- Cool compresses (15-20 minutes several times per day)
- Oatmeal baths (colloidal oatmeal like Aveeno)
- Moisturize with fragrance-free emollient (Cetaphil, CeraVe)

**Follow-Up Plan**:
- **Should improve within 7-10 days** with treatment
- **Recheck if**: No improvement after 7-10 days, spreading despite treatment, signs of infection (purulence, increasing pain, fever)
- **Red flags**: Severe blistering, involvement of mucous membranes (eyes, mouth, genitals) → possible Stevens-Johnson syndrome, needs urgent evaluation

**Prevention**:
- Avoid known allergen/irritant
- Barrier creams (if occupational exposure unavoidable)
- Hypoallergenic cosmetics, detergents, soaps

**Integration with Care Plan**:
- **Identify allergen**: If recurrent, consider patch testing (dermatology referral)
- **Surroundings pillar**: Address environmental exposures (switch to fragrance-free products, avoid latex gloves, remove nickel jewelry, etc.)

## SECTION 9: POST-HOSPITALIZATION / POST-ED VISIT REINTEGRATION

---

### 9.1 Post-Hospitalization Reintegration Protocol

**Objective**: Safely reintegrate patient into comprehensive care plan after hospitalization or ED visit, prevent readmission, update care plan based on acute event

**Timeframe**: Schedule visit within **48-72 hours** of hospital discharge (earlier if high-risk)

**Visit Structure** (30-45 minutes):

#### 1. Review Hospital Records (10 minutes)

**Obtain and review**:
- Discharge summary
- Hospital course (reason for admission, diagnoses, procedures, complications)
- Medication changes (new medications, discontinued medications, dose changes)
- Follow-up recommendations (specialist referrals, testing, monitoring)
- Pending lab/imaging results

**Key questions**:
- What triggered the hospitalization? (Preventable? Complication of chronic disease? Acute unrelated event?)
- What changed during hospitalization? (New diagnoses? Functional decline?)
- What is prognosis/expected recovery timeline?

#### 2. Assess Current Status (10 minutes)

**History**:
- Current symptoms (still present? new symptoms?)
- Medication adherence post-discharge (do they understand new regimen? can they afford new meds?)
- Functional status (can they care for self? ADLs? IADLs?)
- Social support (who's helping at home?)
- Understanding of discharge instructions (do they know why they were hospitalized? what to watch for? when to follow up?)

**Exam**:
- Vital signs
- Targeted exam based on hospitalization reason (e.g., lung exam if pneumonia, wound check if surgery, neuro exam if stroke)
- Assess for red flags (fever, worsening symptoms, complications)

#### 3. Medication Reconciliation (5 minutes)

**Compare**:
- Pre-hospitalization medication list
- Hospital discharge medication list
- Current medications patient is taking

**Clarify**:
- New medications: Why prescribed? How to take? Side effects to watch for?
- Discontinued medications: Why stopped?
- Dose changes: Why adjusted?

**Resolve discrepancies**:
- Patient confusion about what to take
- Duplicate medications
- Missing prescriptions (send to pharmacy if needed)

#### 4. Update Care Plan (10 minutes)

**Reassess Health Matrix**:
- Did hospitalization change traffic light status of any systems?
- Example: Patient hospitalized for MI → Cardiovascular Structure now Orange/Red (new CAD diagnosis), Cardiovascular Risk now Red (secondary prevention needed)

**Adjust Quarterly Plan**:
- **If hospitalization interrupts Q1-Q4 plan**:
  - Temporarily scale back plan (focus on recovery, not progression)
  - Resume full plan once stable (may need to restart quarter or extend timeline)
- **If hospitalization reveals new priority system**:
  - May need to change top 2-3 priority systems
  - Generate new interventions for newly identified high-risk system

**New Interventions Based on Hospitalization**:
- **Medications**: Continue hospital-initiated medications (e.g., dual antiplatelet therapy post-MI, antibiotics for infection, diuretics for CHF exacerbation)
- **Lifestyle modifications**: May need more aggressive lifestyle changes (e.g., cardiac rehab after MI, pulmonary rehab after COPD exacerbation, strict low-sodium diet after CHF admission)
- **Specialist follow-up**: Ensure appointments scheduled (cardiology after MI, pulmonology after COPD exacerbation, etc.)

#### 5. Prevent Readmission (5 minutes)

**Red Flag Education**:
- "What symptoms should prompt you to call us or go back to ED?"
- Provide written red flag list specific to hospitalization diagnosis

**Close Follow-Up Plan**:
- **High-risk patients** (CHF, COPD, recent MI): Follow up weekly × 4 weeks, then biweekly
- **Moderate-risk patients**: Follow up in 1 week, then 2 weeks, then back to quarterly schedule
- **Low-risk patients** (simple procedures, stable): Follow up in 2 weeks, then back to quarterly schedule

**Home Health** (if needed):
- Arrange visiting nurse for wound care, medication management, PT/OT
- Ensure home safety evaluation if functional decline (fall risk, ADL limitations)

**Patient Portal/Phone Check-Ins**:
- Nurse calls patient at 1 week post-discharge to check adherence, answer questions, identify issues early

#### 6. Document and Coordinate (5 minutes)

**Documentation**:
- Update problem list (add new diagnoses from hospitalization)
- Update Health Matrix (reflect new status)
- Update medication list (post-reconciliation)
- Document discharge plan and follow-up

**Coordinate with Specialists**:
- Send updated care plan to relevant specialists
- Request hospital records if not yet received
- Communicate any changes or concerns to specialist

---

### 9.2 Post-ED Visit Follow-Up Protocol

**Objective**: Ensure appropriate follow-up after ED visit, prevent return visits, reintegrate into care plan

**Timeframe**: Phone call within **24 hours**, in-person visit within **3-7 days** (depending on reason for ED visit)

**Phone Call (24 hours post-ED)**:

**Assess**:
- Current status (better? worse? same?)
- Medication adherence (did they fill prescriptions from ED?)
- Understanding of ED diagnosis and discharge instructions
- Red flags (any concerning symptoms?)

**Actions**:
- Schedule in-person follow-up if needed
- Clarify instructions if patient confused
- Address medication barriers (cost, pharmacy issues)
- Escalate if red flags present (urgent visit or return to ED)

**In-Person Visit (3-7 days post-ED)**:

**Follow similar structure to post-hospitalization protocol** (abbreviated):
1. Review ED records (reason for visit, diagnosis, treatment, discharge instructions)
2. Assess current status (history, exam)
3. Medication reconciliation (if meds changed in ED)
4. Update care plan (adjust quarterly plan if needed)
5. Prevent return ED visit (education, close follow-up)

**Common ED Visit Reasons and Follow-Up Actions**:

| ED Visit Reason | Follow-Up Actions |
|----------------|-------------------|
| **Chest pain (ruled out MI)** | Cardiology referral for stress test, reassess cardiovascular risk, optimize preventive medications |
| **Acute asthma exacerbation** | Reassess asthma control, optimize controller medications, review inhaler technique, address triggers |
| **Fall** | Fall risk assessment, home safety evaluation, PT referral, medication review (sedating meds?), address underlying cause |
| **Hypoglycemia** (diabetes patient) | Review diabetes management, adjust medications (reduce insulin/sulfonylurea), CGM if available, diabetes education |
| **Laceration (sutured)** | Wound check in 3-5 days, suture removal in 7-14 days (depending on location), ensure tetanus up to date |
| **Minor fracture** | Orthopedics follow-up, pain management, immobilization, PT after healing |

---

## SECTION 10: TRAINING-RELATED INJURY MANAGEMENT

---

### 10.1 Overuse Injury / Overtraining Syndrome

**Clinical Presentation**: Gradual onset pain/soreness that worsens with continued training, may be associated with fatigue, poor performance, mood changes, sleep disturbance

**Assessment**:
- **History**: Training volume and intensity (recent increases?), recovery time between sessions, sleep quality, nutrition (adequate protein/calories?), stressors outside of training, previous similar injuries
- **Exam**: Focal tenderness at affected site, pain with specific movements, assess for biomechanical issues (weakness, tightness, imbalance)

**Common Overuse Injuries**:
- **Runner's knee** (patellofemoral pain syndrome): Anterior knee pain, worse with stairs/squats
- **Achilles tendinopathy**: Posterior ankle pain, worse with running/jumping
- **Shin splints** (medial tibial stress syndrome): Shin pain along tibia, worse with running
- **Rotator cuff tendinopathy**: Shoulder pain with overhead activities
- **Tennis elbow** (lateral epicondylitis): Elbow pain with gripping/lifting

**Treatment Protocol**:

**Relative Rest**:
- NOT complete rest - but reduce training load by 50% and avoid painful activities
- Cross-train (if knee pain → switch to swimming or cycling; if shoulder pain → focus on lower body)

**RICE** (for acute flare-ups):
- Rest (from painful activity), Ice (20 min after training), Compression (if swelling), Elevation (if swelling)

**NSAIDs** (short-term, for pain/inflammation):
- Ibuprofen 400-600mg PO TID × 5-7 days (with food)

**Physical Therapy**:
- **Refer to PT** for:
  - Eccentric strengthening exercises (critical for tendinopathy)
  - Biomechanical assessment and correction
  - Progressive return-to-training protocol

**Address Root Causes**:
- **Training error** (too much, too soon): Implement 10% rule (increase volume by ≤10% per week)
- **Inadequate recovery**: Ensure 1-2 rest days per week, adequate sleep, deload weeks every 4th week
- **Nutritional deficiency**: Ensure adequate protein (1.6-2.2 g/kg), calories, vitamin D
- **Biomechanical issue**: Address muscle imbalances, weakness, tightness

**Follow-Up Plan**:
- **Recheck in 2-4 weeks**: Assess response to relative rest and PT
- **Gradual return to training**: Once pain-free with ADLs, begin progressive return (start at 50% volume, increase 10% per week if pain-free)
- **Red flags**: Worsening pain despite rest, night pain, severe swelling, inability to bear weight → may need imaging (X-ray, MRI)

**Integration with Care Plan**:
- **Modify quarterly plan**: If overuse injury occurs during Q2 Build or Q3 Optimize phase, return to Q1 Foundation level until healed
- **Reassess training progression**: Was progression too fast? Adjust quarterly plan to be more conservative
- **Incorporate injury prevention**: Add specific strengthening exercises to Movement prescription (e.g., hip strengthening for runner's knee, rotator cuff strengthening for shoulder)
- **Reassess Musculoskeletal Function domain**: If recurrent overuse injuries, escalate to orange priority, consider PT evaluation
