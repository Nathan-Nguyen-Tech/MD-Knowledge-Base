# Life Stage Health Goals Framework

## Overview

**Purpose**: Define evidence-based, clinician-recommended health goals for each life stage that synergize with patients' personal goals while addressing stage-specific biological, developmental, and functional priorities.

**Clinical Rationale**: Different life stages have distinct physiological priorities, disease risks, and functional demands. Aligning clinical care with these stage-specific goals ensures interventions are developmentally appropriate, personally relevant, and maximize long-term health trajectory.

## Integration with Care Planning

### How Life Stage Goals Populate Care Plans

Each care plan includes:

1. **Life Stage Section** (Auto-populated based on age)
   - Current life stage identified
   - Stage-specific clinical goals listed
   - Patient's personal goals elicited and documented

2. **Goal Alignment Matrix**
   - Clinical goals mapped to patient's personal goals
   - Show how optimizing health enables life pursuits

**Example: 58-year-old woman, Stage 4 (Late Middle Age)**

| Clinical Goal (Stage 4) | Health System | Patient's Personal Goal | How They Align |
|-------------------------|---------------|------------------------|----------------|
| Aggressive CVD prevention | Cardiovascular Risk | "I want to travel Europe with my husband when he retires in 3 years" | Preventing heart attack ensures travel is possible; optimizing fitness enables walking tours |
| Preserve functional capacity | Musculoskeletal Function | "I want to keep up with my 3-year-old grandson" | Building strength and endurance allows active grandparenting |

- ☐ Newborn screening complete (metabolic, hearing, heart defects)

**Stage 2 (Pediatric - Early Childhood, 2-5 years)**
- ☐ Healthy growth (BMI 5th-85th percentile, not obese)
- ☐ Motor skills advancing (gross motor, fine motor age-appropriate)
- ☐ Language development on track (vocabulary, sentence formation)
- ☐ Healthy eating patterns (balanced diet, limit sugar)
- ☐ Injury prevention (car seat, water safety, childproofing)
- ☐ Social-emotional development (emotional regulation, peer play)
- ☐ Vaccinations complete (DTaP, MMR, Varicella boosters)
- ☐ Vision and hearing screening (age 3-5)

**Stage 3 (Pediatric - Middle Childhood, 6-12 years)**
- ☐ Growth monitored (prevent obesity - BMI <85th percentile)
- ☐ Physical fitness building (sports, 60 min activity/day)
- ☐ Academic success (screen for learning disabilities if struggling)
- ☐ Healthy sleep (9-12 hrs/night)
- ☐ Dental health (brushing, flossing, dental visits)
- ☐ Social-emotional health (peer relationships, bullying prevention)
- ☐ Puberty development monitored (Tanner staging if age-appropriate)
- ☐ Vaccinations (Tdap, HPV, meningococcal at age 11-12)
- ☐ Sports injury prevention (helmets, protective gear, concussion screening)

**Stage 4 (13-25): Development & Foundation**
- ☐ Physical development on track (growth charts, puberty milestones)
- ☐ Movement capacity building (sports participation, strength training)
- ☐ Healthy lifestyle patterns (sleep 8-10 hrs, nutrition, no smoking/vaping)
- ☐ Mental health screening (depression, anxiety, substance use)
- ☐ Reproductive health education (contraception, STI prevention)

**Stage 5 (26-39): Performance & Reproduction**
- ☐ Reproductive health optimized (regular cycles, preconception care if planning pregnancy)
- ☐ Cardiometabolic prevention (BP <120/80, A1c <5.7%, normal lipids)
- ☐ High performance capacity (sleep 7-9 hrs, exercise 150+ min/week, energy stable)
- ☐ Resilience building (stress management, HRV tracking, illness recovery <1 week)

**Stage 6 (40-54): Optimization & Prevention**
- ☐ Chronic disease reversal (prediabetes → normal, prehypertension → normal)
- ☐ Musculoskeletal preservation (resistance training 2x/week, DEXA if indicated)
- ☐ Metabolic flexibility (fasting tolerance, post-meal glucose <140, body composition)
- ☐ Hormonal support (perimenopause management, testosterone optimization)
- ☐ Cancer screening initiated (mammography, colonoscopy, cervical screening)

**Stage 7 (55-64): Preservation & Transition**
- ☐ Aggressive CVD prevention (ASCVD risk <10%, advanced lipids, CAC score if indicated)
- ☐ Functional capacity preserved (6MWT >400m, sit-to-stand ≥12 reps, grip strength normal)
- ☐ Bone health optimized (DEXA at 65, vitamin D + calcium, resistance training)
- ☐ Chronic disease controlled (A1c <7%, BP <130/80, CKD monitoring if present)
- ☐ Cancer screening complete (mammography, colonoscopy, lung CT if indicated)

**Stage 8 (65-79): Function & Independence**
- ☐ Fall prevention program (balance training, home safety, medication review)
- ☐ Cognitive function monitored (MoCA annually, hearing screening, social engagement)
- ☐ Independence maintained (ADLs/IADLs assessment, driving evaluation if concerns)
- ☐ Chronic disease optimized (complication prevention, avoid hypoglycemia)
- ☐ Frailty prevention (protein 1.2-1.5 g/kg, resistance training, avoid weight loss)
- ☐ Vaccination status (flu, pneumonia, COVID, shingles)

**Stage 9 (80+): Quality of Life & Dignity**
- ☐ Quality of life prioritized (pain control, symptom management, comfort)
- ☐ Catastrophic event prevention (falls, fractures, hospitalizations)
- ☐ Functional support (assisted devices, home health, ADL assistance)
- ☐ Medication simplification (deprescribe low-yield drugs, avoid polypharmacy)
- ☐ Advance care planning (goals of care, code status, end-of-life wishes)

## Summary

**Life Stage Health Goals Framework ensures**:
- Age-appropriate clinical priorities guide every care plan **(from infancy to advanced age)**
- Developmental, biological, and functional realities shape recommendations
- Clinical goals synergize with personal/family goals (not conflict with them)
- Care plans feel relevant and motivating (not generic or disconnected)
- No critical stage-specific interventions are missed (e.g., developmental milestones at age 2, bone density at 65, fall prevention at 70)
- **Pediatric care** addresses growth, development, prevention, and family-centered goals
- **Adult care** addresses performance, prevention, chronic disease management, and aging

**This framework transforms care planning from reactive disease management to proactive, stage-aligned health optimization across the entire lifespan.**
