### Level 3: Weak/Conditional Recommendation
- Limited RCT evidence
- Inconsistent results across studies
- Mechanistic reasoning with preliminary data

### Level 4: Expert Opinion/Insufficient Evidence
- No high-quality trials
- Expert consensus based on experience
- Mechanistic plausibility
- Clearly communicated as preliminary
- Examples: HRV-guided training (emerging), some personalized nutrition approaches

### Rejected: No Evidence or Disproven
